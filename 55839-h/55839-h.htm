<p><i><span class="smcap">This</span> is an entirely distinct book from the
first series of the Law&#8217;s Lumber Room.
The subjects are of more general interest,
they are treated with greater fulness of
detail, most are as much literary as legal;
but I have thought it best to retain the
old name. No other seemed so briefly and
so truly descriptive of papers which tell
what the law and its ways once were, and
what they have ceased, one may reasonably
suppose, for ever to be.</i></p>

<p><i>I make two remarks. There is a great
deal of hanging in this book; that is only
because those were hanging times. The law
had no thought of mending the criminal; it
ended him in the most summary fashion.
The death of the chief actors was as inevitably
the finish of the story as it is in
a modern French novel.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span><i>Again, in pondering those memories of
the past, one realises how much, in other
things than mechanical invention, our time
is unlike all that went before. This is not
the commonplace it seems, for not easily do
we realise how far the change has gone.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6"><i>Under the sway</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Of Death, the past&#8217;s enormous disarray</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Lies hushed and dark.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p><i>Details such as make up this volume have
this merit: they bring the antique world before
us, and the net result seems to be this: we lead
better lives, we are more just and charitable,
perhaps less selfish than our forefathers,
but how to deny that something is lost? for
life is not so exciting, and our annals are
anything but picturesque.</i></p>

<p><i>These papers were originally published
in</i> The New Review, The Yellow Book,
<i>and</i> The Ludgate. <i>I have made very considerable
additions to most of them, and all
have been carefully revised.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To-day</span> you cannot fix the exact spot where
Tyburn Tree raised its uncanny form. To
the many it was the most noteworthy thing
about Old London, yet while thousands who
had gazed thereon in fascinated horror were
still in life, a certain vagueness was evident
in men&#8217;s thoughts, and, albeit antiquaries
have keenly debated the <i>locus</i>, all the mind
is clouded with a doubt, and your carefully
worked out conclusion is but guesswork.
There is reason manifold for this. Of
old time the populous district known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Tyburnia was wild heath intersected by the
Tyburn Brook, which, rising near Hampstead,
crossed what is now Oxford Street, hard by
the Marble Arch, and so on to Chelsea and
the Thames. Somewhere on its banks was
the Middlesex gallows. It may be that as
the tide set westward the site was changed.
Again, the wild heath is now thick with
houses; new streets and squares have confused
the ancient landmarks; those who dwelt
therein preferred that there should not be a
too nice identification of localities. How
startling the reflection that in the very place
of your dining-room, thousands of fellow-creatures
had dangled in their last agonies!
How rest at ease in such a chamber of
horrors? The weight of evidence favours
(or disfavours) No. 49 Connaught Square.
The Bishop of London is ground landlord
here; and it is said that in the lease of that
house granted by him the fact is recorded
that there stood the &#8220;Deadly Never-Green.&#8221;
Such a record were purely gratuitous, but
the draftsman may have made it to fix the
identity of the dwelling. But to-day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Square runs but to No. 47. Some shuffling
of numerals has, you fancy, taken place to
baffle indiscreet research. However, you may
be informed (in confidence) that you have but
to stand at the south-east corner of the Square
to be &#8220;warm,&#8221; as children say in their games.</p>

<p>Let these minutiæ go. Tyburn Tree
stood within a gunshot to the north-west of
the Marble Arch. Its pictured shape is
known from contemporary prints. There
were three tall uprights, joined at the top by
three cross-beams, the whole forming a triangle.
It could accommodate many patients
at once, and there is some authority for
supposing that the beam towards Paddington
was specially used for Roman Catholics. In
the last century the nicer age objected to it
as an eyesore; and it was replaced by a
movable structure, fashioned of two uprights
and a cross-beam, which was set up in the
Edgware Road at the corner of Bryanston
Street, and which, the grim work done, was
stored in the corner house, from whose
windows the sheriffs superintended executions.
To accommodate genteel spectators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
there were just such stands as you find on a
racecourse, the seats whereof were let at
divers prices, according to the interest
excited. In 1758, for Dr. Henesey&#8217;s execution
as arch-traitor, the rate rose to two
shillings and two and sixpence a seat. The
Doctor was &#8220;most provokingly reprieved,&#8221;
whereat the mob in righteous indignation
arose and wrecked the stands. Mammy
Douglas, a woman who kept the key of one
of these stands, was popularly known as &#8220;the
Tyburn pew-opener.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanciful etymologists played mad pranks
with the name. In Fuller&#8217;s <i>Worthies, Tieburne</i>
is derived on vague authority from
&#8220;Tie&#8221; and &#8220;Burne,&#8221; because the &#8220;poor
Lollards&#8221; there &#8220;had their necks <i>tied</i> to the
beame and their lower parts <i>burnt</i> in the
fire. Others&#8221; (he goes on more sensibly)
&#8220;will have it called from <i>Twa</i> and <i>Burne</i>,
that is two rivulets, which it seems meet
near the place.&#8221; And then it was plainly a
<i>Bourn</i> whence no traveller returned! Most
probably it is a shortened form of <i>The</i>, or <i>At
the Aye Bourne</i> (= <i>&#8217;t Aye-bourne</i> = <i>Tyburn</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
or Brook already denoted. Tyburn was not
always London&#8217;s sole or even principal place
of execution. In early times people were
hanged as well as burned at Smithfield. The
elms at St. Giles&#8217;s were far too handy a
provision to stay idle. At Tower Green
was the chosen spot for beheading your high-class
criminal, and it was common to put off
a malefactor on the very theatre of his malefaction.
There are few spots in Old London
which have not carried a gallows at one or
other time. Some think that certain elm-trees
suggested the choice of Tyburn. In the
end it proved the most convenient of all,
being neither too near nor too far; and in
the end its name came to have (as is common
with such words) a general application, and
was applied at York, Liverpool, Dublin, and
elsewhere, to the place of execution.</p>

<p>To-day the criminal&#8217;s progress from cell
to gallows is an affair of a few minutes. To
an earlier time this had savoured of indecent
haste. Then, the way to Tyburn, long in
itself, was lengthened out by the observance
of a complicated ritual, some of it of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
origin. Let us follow &#8220;the poor inhabitant
below&#8221; from the dock to the rope. To
understand what follows one must remember
that two distinct sets of forces acted on his
mind:&mdash;on the one hand, the gloom of the
prison, the priest&#8217;s advice, the memory of
mis-spent days, the horror of doom; on the
other, the reaction of a lawless nature against
a cruel code, the resolve to die game, the
flattering belief that he was the observed of
all observers, and perhaps a secret conviction
that the unknown could be no worse than
the known. According as the one set or
other prevailed he was penitent or brazen,
the Ordinary&#8217;s darling or the people&#8217;s joy.
Well, his Lordship having assumed the black
cap and pronounced sentence of death, the
convict was forthwith removed to the condemned
hold in Newgate. There he was
heavily fettered, and, if of any renown as a
prison-breaker, chained to a ring in the
ground. Escape was not hopeless. Friends
were allowed to visit and supply him with
money, wherewith he might bribe his keepers;
and the prison discipline, though cruel, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
incredibly lax (Jack Sheppard&#8217;s two escapes
from the condemned hold, carefully described
by Ainsworth, are cases in point). To
resume, our felon was now frequently visited
by the Ordinary, who zealously inquired
(from the most interested motives) into his
past life, and admonished him of his approaching
doom. At chapel o&#8217; Sundays he
sat with his fellows in the condemned pew, a
large dock-like erection painted black, which
stood in the centre, right in front of and
close to the ordinary&#8217;s desk and pulpit. For
his last church-going the condemned sermon
was preached, the burial service was read,
and prayers were put up &#8220;especially for
those awaiting the awful execution of the
law.&#8221; The reprieved also were present, and
the chapel was packed with as many spectators
as could squeeze their way in.</p>

<p>Now, our old law was not so bad as it
seemed. True, the death-penalty was affixed
to small offences; but it was comparatively
rarely exacted. In looking over Old Bailey
sessions-papers of from one to two centuries
ago, I am struck with the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
acquittals&mdash;brought about, I fancy, by the
triviality of the crime, not the innocence of
the prisoner&mdash;and jurors constantly appraised
the articles at twelve pence or under to reduce
the offence to petty larceny, which was
not capital, and after sentence each case was
carefully considered on its merits by the King
in Council (the extraordinary care which
George III. gave to this matter is well known:
he was often found pondering sentences late
into the night). Only when the offender
was inveterate or his crime atrocious was the
death-penalty exacted. In effect, cases now
punished by long terms of penal servitude
were then ordered for execution. I don&#8217;t
pretend to say whether or no to-day&#8217;s plan
may be the more merciful. We have, on the
authority of the Newgate Ordinary, a list
between 1700 and 1711. Of forty-nine condemned
in one year, thirty-six were reprieved
and thirteen executed, in another year thirty-eight
were condemned, twenty were reprieved,
and eighteen were executed; the highest
annual return of executions during that
period was sixty-six, the lowest five. An Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of 1753 (25 Geo. II., c. 37) provided for the
speedy exit and dissection of murderers; but
the fate of other felons might hang dubious,
as weeks often elapsed without a Privy Council
meeting. The Recorder of London brought
up the report from Windsor. When it
reached Newgate, usually late at night, the
condemned prisoners were assembled in one
ward. The Ordinary entered in full canonicals
and spoke his fateful message to each
kneeling wretch. &#8220;I am sorry to tell you it
is all against you,&#8221; would fall on one man&#8217;s
trembling ears; while &#8220;Your case has been
taken into consideration by the King and
Council and His Majesty has been mercifully
pleased to spare your life,&#8221; was the comfortable
word for another. The reprieved now
returned thanks to God and the King; the
others, all hope gone, must return to the
condemned hold.</p>

<p>There broke in on them here, during the
midnight hours on the eve of their execution,
the sound of twelve strokes of a hand-bell,
the while a doleful voice in doleful rhyme
addressed them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">You prisoners that are within,</div>
<div class="verse">Who for wickedness and sin....</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here the rhyme failed; but in not less dismal
prose the voice admonished them that
on the morrow &#8220;the greatest bell of St.
Sepulchre will toll for you in the form and
manner of a passing bell&#8221;; wherefore it behoved
them to repent. In later years the
songster procured himself this rigmarole:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die.</div>
<div class="verse">Watch all and pray, the hour is drawing near</div>
<div class="verse">When you before th&#8217; Almighty must appear.</div>
<div class="indent">Examine well yourselves; in time repent,</div>
<div class="indent">That you may not th&#8217; eternal flames be sent.</div>
<div class="verse">And when St. &#8217;Pulcre&#8217;s bell to-morrow tolls,</div>
<div class="verse">The Lord have mercy on your souls!</div>
<div class="indent10">Past twelve o&#8217;clock.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now this iron nightingale was the sexton
or his deputy of St. Sepulchre&#8217;s, hard by
Newgate; and his chant originated thus.
In the early seventeenth century there flourished
a certain Robert Dowe, &#8220;citizen and
merchant taylor of London&#8221;; he disbursed
much of his estate to various charities, and
in especial gave one pound six shillings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
eight pence yearly to the sexton of St.
Sepulchre&#8217;s to approach as near as might be
to the condemned hold on execution eve, and
admonish malefactors of their approaching
end, as if they were likely to forget it, or as
if &#8220;Men in their Condition cou&#8217;d have any
stomach to Unseasonable Poetry,&#8221; so pertinently
observes John Hall (executed about
1708), &#8220;the late famous and notorious
robber,&#8221; or rather the Grub Street hack who
compiled his <i>Memoirs</i>. The rhymes were, so
the same veracious authority assures us, &#8220;set
to the Tune of the Bar-Bell at the Black
Dog,&#8221; and their reception varied. Hall and
his companions (but again you suspect Grub
Street) paid in kind with verse equally edifying,
and, if possible, still more atrocious.
Most, you fancy, turned again to their uneasy
slumbers with muttered curses. Not so
Sarah Malcolm, condemned in 1733 for the
cruel murder of old Mrs. Duncombe, her
mistress. An unseasonable pity for the
sexton croaking his platitudes in the raw
midnight possessed her mad soul. &#8220;D&#8217;ye
hear, Mr. Bellman?&#8221; she bawled, &#8220;call for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Pint of Wine, and I&#8217;ll throw you a Shilling
to pay for it.&#8221; How instant his changed
note as the coin clinked on the pavement!
Alas! no record reports him thus again
refreshed.</p>

<p>But <i>Venit summa dies et ineluctabile fatum</i>
(a tag you may be sure the Ordinary rolled
off to any broken-down scholar he had in
hand); and our felon&#8217;s last day dawns. He
is taken to the Stone Hall, where his irons
are struck off; then he is pinioned by the
yeoman of the halter, who performs that
service for the moderate fee of five shillings
(rope thrown in). At the gate he is delivered
over to the Hangman (who is not free of the
prison), and by him he is set in the cart (a
sorry vehicle drawn by a sorry nag in sorry
harness), his coffin oft at his feet, and the
Ordinary at his side, and so, amidst the yells
of a huge mob and to the sad accompaniment
of St. Sepulchre&#8217;s bell, the cart moves
westward. Almost immediately a halt is
called. The road is bounded by the wall of
St. Sepulchre&#8217;s Churchyard, over the which
there peers our vocalist of yester-eve, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
takes up his lugubrious whine anew:&mdash;&#8220;All
good people pray heartily with God for the
poor sinners who are now going to their
death,&#8221; with more to the same effect, for all
which the poor passenger must once more
bless or curse the name of the inconsiderately
considerate Dowe. He gave his endowment
in 1605, seven years before his death: had
some mad turn of fate made him an object
of his own charity you had scarce grieved.
But now the sexton has done his office to the
satisfaction of the beadle of Merchant Tailors&#8217;
Hall, who &#8220;hath an honest stipend allowed
him to see that this is duly done,&#8221; and the
cart is again under weigh, when, if the principal
subject be popular, a lady (you assume
her beauty, and you need not rake the
rubbish of two centuries for witness against
her character) trips down the steps of St.
Sepulchre&#8217;s Church and presents him with a
huge nosegay. If nosegays be not in season,
&#8220;why, then,&#8221; as the conjuror assured Timothy
Crabshaw, squire to Sir Launcelot Greaves,
&#8220;an orange will do as well.&#8221; And now the
cart rumbles down steep and strait Snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Hill, crosses the Fleet Ditch by narrow
Holborn Bridge, creaks up Holborn Hill
(the &#8220;Heavy Hill,&#8221; men named it with
sinister twin-meaning), and so through
Holborn Bars, whilst the bells, first of St.
Andrew&#8217;s, Holborn, and then of St. Giles-in-the-Fields,
knell sadly as it passes. In the
High Street of the ancient village of that
name, Halt! is again the word. Of old
time a famous Lazar-House stood here, and
hard by those elms of St. Giles, already noted
as a place of execution. The simple piety of
mediæval times would dispatch no wretch on
so long a journey without sustenance. Hence
at the Lazar-House gate he was given a huge
bowl of ale, his &#8220;last refreshing in this life,&#8221;
whereof he might drink at will. The most
gallant of the Elizabethans has phrased for
us the felon&#8217;s thoughts as he quaffed the
strange draught. On that chill October
morning when Raleigh went to his doom at
Westminster, some one handed him &#8220;a cup
of excellent sack,&#8221; courteously inquiring how
he liked it? &#8220;As the fellow,&#8221; he answered
with a last touch of Elizabethan wit, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
drinking of St. Giles&#8217;s bowl as he went to
Tyburn, said:&mdash;&#8216;That were good drink if a
man might tarry by it.&#8217;&#8221; The Lazar went,
but the St. Giles&#8217;s bowl lingered, only no
longer a shaven monk, but the landlord of
the Bowl or the Crown, or what not, handed
up the liquor.</p>

<p>Bowl Yard, which vanished into Endell
Street, long preserved the memory of this
&#8220;last refreshing.&#8221; At York a like custom
prevailed, whereof local tradition recorded a
quaint apologue. The saddler of Bawtry
needs must hang&mdash;why and wherefore no
man knoweth. To the amazement and
horror of all he most churlishly refused the
proffered bowl. Pity was but wasted (so
our forefathers thought) on such a fellow.
Before a dry-eyed crowd he was strung up
with the utmost dispatch, but a reprieve
arriving, was cut down just as quickly. All
too late, however! He was done with this
world. Had he but reasonably tarried, as
others did, for his draught, he had died in
his bed like many a better man. Hence the
rustic moralist taught how the saddler of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Bawtry was hanged for leaving of his ale.
The compilers of the Sunday school treatises
have scandalously neglected this leading case
of lost opportunities. Nay, though a pearl
&#8220;richer than all his tribe,&#8221; you shall search
the works of Dr. Smiles for it in vain.</p>

<p>But the day wears on, and our procession
must farther westward along Tyburn Road
(now Oxford Street). It is soon quit of
houses; yet the crowd grows ever denser,
and, though Tyburn Tree stands out grim
and gaunt in our view, it is some time ere
the cart pulls up under the beam. Soon the
halter is fixed, and the parson says his last
words to the trembling wretch. And now
it is proper for him to address the crowd,
confessing his crimes, and warning others to
amend their ways. If a broken-down cleric
or the like, his last devotions and dying
speech are apt to be prosy and inordinate;
so that the mob jeers or even pelts him and
his trusty Ketch himself. Or &#8220;some of the
Sheriff&#8217;s officers discovering impatience to
have the execution dispatched&#8221; (thus Samuel
Smith, the Ordinary of a case in 1684), Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
cuts things short by whipping up his horses
and leaves his victim dangling and agape.
More decorously the cap is drawn over his
face, and he himself gives the signal to turn
off. The Hangman, if in genial mood, now
stretches the felon&#8217;s legs for him, or thumps
his breast with the benevolent design of
expelling the last breath; but the brute is
usually too lazy or too careless, and these
pious offices are performed by friends.</p>

<p>The accessories of such a last scene are
preserved in Hogarth&#8217;s <i>Apprentice</i> Series.
One of the crowd is picking a pocket, and
you foresee him ending here some day soon.
(Is it not told of one rascal, that he urged
on the attendants his right to a near view,
since, sure of hanging some day, he naturally
wished to see how it was done?) Another
in the crowd is bawling, a trifle prematurely,
the last speech and dying confession of
Thomas Idle. Verses commemorative of
the occasion were sold broadcast. &#8220;Tyburn&#8217;s
elegiac lines,&#8221; as you may suppose, were sad
doggerel. Here is the concluding portion of
a specimen (<i>temp. circa</i> 1720):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Fifteen of us you soon will see</div>
<div class="verse">Ending our days with misery</div>
<div class="indent">At the Tree, at the Tree.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Even at Tyburn, how hard to renounce
all hope! There was ever the chance of a
reprieve. There is at least one well-authenticated
case of a man making a sudden bolt
from the cart, and almost escaping; and, as
the <i>modus</i> was simple strangulation, and the
Hangman careless or corrupt, it was just
possible that heroic remedies might restore
to animation. On December 12, 1705, John
Smith was turned off, and hung for a
quarter of an hour. A reprieve arriving,
he was cut down, and coaxed back to life.
More remarkable was the case of William
Duell, in 1740. To all appearance
thoroughly well hanged, he was carried off
for dissection to Surgeons&#8217; Hall, where he
presently recovered himself. He was, somewhat
cruelly, restored to Newgate, but was
let off with transportation. The law was
not always so merciful. In another case,
the sheriff&#8217;s officers, having heard that their
prey was again alive and kicking, hunted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
wretch out, haled him back to Tyburn, and
hanged him beyond the possibility of doubt.
The rumour of such marvels inspired many
attempts at resuscitation. I fancy about
one per cent. were successful, but how to
tell, since the instance just quoted shows that
such triumphs were better concealed?</p>

<p>Now, the <i>corpus</i> is essential to the <i>experimentum</i>,
so half an hour after the turning
off, the friends bring up a deal coffin, borne
across an unhinged coach door or any such
make-shift bier. But Ketch is still in possession:
the clothes are Hangman&#8217;s perquisites,
and must be purchased. How the
greedy rascal appreciates the value of each
button, dwells on the splendour of each
sorry ornament, watching the while and
gauging the impatience of the buyers!
Never went second-hand duds at such
a figure! Sometimes he overreaches himself,
or no one comes forward to bid. Then
the corpse is rudely stripped, &#8220;and the Miscellany
of Rags are all crushed into a sack
which the Valet de Chambre carries on
purpose, and being digested into Monmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Street, Chick Lane, &amp;c., are comfortably
worn by many an industrious fellow.&#8221; And
sometimes the law claims the body to be
removed and hung in chains.</p>

<p>In cases of treason, the felon was drawn
to Tyburn in a sledge tied to a horse&#8217;s tail;
he was hanged from the cart; but was cut
down and dismembered alive. His head
went to the adornment of Temple Bar or
London Bridge; while his quarters, having
been boiled in oil and tar in a cauldron in
Jack Ketch&#8217;s Kitchen, as the room above the
central gateway at Newgate was called, were
scattered here and there as the authorities
fancied. The complete ritual of disgrace
was reserved for political offenders. After
rebellions Ketch had his hands full. He
would tumble out of his sack good store of
heads wherewith he and the Newgate felons
made hideous sport, preliminary to parboiling
them with bay salt and cummin seed:
the one for preservation, the other sovereign
against the fowls of the air. If the traitor
were a woman, she was burned (till 1790);
but usually strangled first. Cases are on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
record where, with a fire too quick or a
Hangman too clumsy, the choking proved
abortive and&mdash;&mdash;! The sledge so often
supplanted the less ignominious cart, that I
ought to explain that a traitor need not be a
political offender. Certain coining offences,
the murder of a husband by his wife, and of
a master by his servant, were all ranked a
form of treason, and the criminal was drawn
and quartered or burnt accordingly.</p>

<p>Two of Tyburn&#8217;s officials, the Ordinary and
the Hangman, to wit, now claim our attention.
The Ordinary, or prison chaplain of
Newgate, said &#8220;Amen&#8221; to the death sentence,
and ministered to the convict thence to the
end. A terrible duty, to usher your fellow-man
from this world into the next! I have
heard that one such task near proved fatal
to an honest divine; but the hand of little
employment hath the daintier sense, and too
often the Newgate Ordinary was a callous
wretch, with a keen zeal for the profits of
his post, and for the rest a mere praying
machine. He needs must be good trencherman.
It was one of his strange duties to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
say grace at City banquets. Major Griffiths,
who collects so many curious facts in his
<i>Chronicles of Newgate</i>, alleges him not seldom
required to eat three consecutive dinners
without quitting the table. In post-Tyburn
days, when they hanged in front of the
prison, the governor&#8217;s daughter used to
prepare breakfast for those attending each
execution (the <i>deid clack</i>, so they called such
festivity in Old Scotland). Broiled kidneys
were her masterpiece, and she noted that,
whilst most of her pale-faced guests could
stomach nought save brandy and water, his
reverence attacked the dish as one appetised
by a prosperous morning&#8217;s work. Most
Ordinaries are clean gone from memory,
unrecorded even by <i>The Dictionary of
National Biography</i>. One (as fly in amber!)
the chance reference of a classic now and
again preserves.</p>

<p class="center">E&#8217;en Guthrie spares half Newgate by a dash,</p>

<p>sneers Pope, referring to an alleged habit of
merely giving initials. I have turned over a
fair number of the Reverend James Guthrie&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
accounts of criminals. In those he always
writes the name in full. The witty though
himself forgotten Tom Brown scribbles the
epitaph of the Reverend Samuel Smith,
another Ordinary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div>

<p>And there were the Reverend Thomas
Purney, and the Reverend John Villette,
but these be well-nigh empty names. We
know most about the Reverend Paul Lorrain,
who was appointed in 1698, and died in
1719, leaving the respectable fortune of
£5000. A typical Ordinary of the baser
sort this; a greedy, gross, sensual wretch,
who thrived and grew fat on the perquisites
of his office. Among these was a broadsheet,
published at eight o&#8217;clock the morning after
a hanging. It was headed, &#8220;The Ordinary
of Newgate, his Account of the Behaviour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Confessions, and Last Speeches of the Malefactors
who were executed at Tyburn, the&mdash;.&#8221;
It gave the names and sentences of
the convicts, copious notes of the sermons
(of the most wooden type) he preached at
them, biographies, and confessions, and finally
the scenes at the gallows. Let the up-to-date
journalist cherish Lorrain&#8217;s name. He
was an early specimen of the personal interviewer:
he had the same keen scent for unsavoury
detail, the same total disregard for
the feelings or wishes of his victim, the same
readiness to betray confidence; and he had
his subject at such an advantage! You
imagine the sanctimonious air wherewith
he produced his notebook and invited the
wretch&#8217;s statement. With the scene at
Tyburn variety in detail was impossible.
&#8220;Afterwards the Cart drew away, and they
were turn&#8217;d off,&#8221; is his formula. You had a
good twopenn&#8217;orth, such was his usual modest
charge! The first page top was embellished
with two cuts: on the left Old Newgate Archway,
on the right Tyburn Tree. (Gurney
affected a quainter design, wherein he stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in full canonicals in the centre pointing the
way to Heaven, whilst on his left the Fiend,
furnished with a trident, squirmed in a bed of
flames.) The broadsheet was authenticated
by his signature.</p>

<p>Now, two things made the Reverend Paul
exceeding wroth. One was the issue of
pirated confessions, which were &#8220;a great
Cheat and Imposture upon the World,&#8221; and
they would not merely forge his name but
mis-spell it to boot! His is &#8220;the only true
<i>Account</i> of the Dying Criminals,&#8221; he urgently,
and no doubt truly, asserts. All this touched
his pocket, hence his ire, which blazed no less
against the unrepentant malefactor, who&mdash;a
scarce less grievous offence&mdash;touched his professional
pride. He did not mince words:&mdash;&#8220;he
was a Notorious and Hard-hearted
Criminal,&#8221; or afflicted with brutish ignorance
or of an obstinate and hardened disposition.
&#8220;There is,&#8221; he would pointedly remark, &#8220;<i>a
Lake of Brimstone, a Worm that dies not,
and a Fire which shall never be quenched</i>.
And this I must plainly tell you, that will be
your dismal portion there for ever, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
you truly Repent here in time.&#8221; And after
&#8220;Behaviour&#8221; in the title of his broadsheets,
he would insert, in parentheses, &#8220;or rather
Misbehaviour.&#8221; Most of his flock, stupid
with terror, passively acquiesced in everything
he said. These &#8220;Lorrain saints,&#8221; as Steele
called them, received ready absolution at his
hands and their reported end was most
edifying. But in James Sheppard (the
Jacobite), who suffered March 17, 1718,
for treason, Lorrain had a most vexatious
subject. A non-juring divine, &#8220;that Priest
or Jesuit, or Wolf in Sheep&#8217;s clothing,&#8221; as
the Rev. Paul describes him, attended the
convict, and the Ordinary&#8217;s services were
quite despised. The intruder, &#8220;e&#8217;en at the
<i>Gallows</i>, had the Presumption to give him
Publick Absolution, tho&#8217; he visibly dy&#8217;d
without Repentance.&#8221; Dr. Doran assures
us that, on the way to Tyburn, Paul and
his supplanter came to fisticuffs, and our
Ordinary was unceremoniously kicked from
the cart. One would like to believe this
entertaining legend, for &#8220;the great historiographer,&#8221;
as Pope and Bolingbroke sarcastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
dub him, grows less in your favour the
more you scan his sheets. His account of
Sheppard concludes with the most fulsome
professions of loyalty to the King and the
Protestant Succession, for which he is ready
to sacrifice his life. You note that he was
charged with administering the sacrament
for temporal ends, some scandal apparently
of shamful traffic in the elements. There is
no proof&mdash;indeed, we have nothing to go
on but his own denial; but it shows the
gossip whereof he was the centre. He had
ingenious methods of spreading his sale.
Thus he tells his readers that a fuller
account of a special case will be published
along with that of prisoners that go for
execution to-morrow. In the case of Nathaniel
Parkhurst, hanged May 20, 1715,
for the murder of Count Lewis Pleuro, he
actually reports the convict on the eve of
his execution cracking up in advance the
report which his ghostly comforter will
presently publish! Strange advertisements
fill up the odd corners of his broadsheets.
Here he puffs a manual of devotion by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
himself; there the virtue of a quack medicine,
some sovran remedy for colic, gout,
toothache, &#8220;The Itch or any Itching
Humour.&#8221; Again, you have &#8220;The works of
Petronius Arbiter, with Cuts and a Key,&#8221; or
&#8220;Apuleius&#8217;s Golden Ass,&#8221; or some lewd
publication of the day. Even if the advertisements
were Paul&#8217;s publishers&#8217;, how
strange the man and the time that suffered
so incongruous a mixture! Our Ordinary
petitioned parliament that his precious
broadsheets might go free of the paper tax,
by reason of their edifying nature!</p>

<p>Turn we now to the Hangman. No rare
figure <i>his</i> in Old England! Only in later
years was he individualised. In James I.&#8217;s
time a certain Derrick filled the office. The
playwrights keep his memory green, and the
crane so called is said to take its name from
him. Then there came Gregory Brandon,
who had &#8220;a fair coat of arms,&#8221; and the title
of esquire in virtue of his office. This was
through a mad practical joke of York
Herald, who, perceiving a solemn ass in
Garter King-at-Arms, sent him in the papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
somewhat ambiguously worded, and got the
grant in due form. York and Garter were
presently laid by the heels in the Marshalsea,
&#8220;one for foolery, the other for knavery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gregory was succeeded by his son, also called
Gregory, though his real name was Richard.
His infantile amusement was the heading
of cats and dogs, his baby fingers seemed
ever adjusting imaginary halters on invisible
necks; he was &#8220;the destined heir, From his
soft cradle, to his father&#8217;s chair&#8221;&mdash;or rather
cart and ladder. The younger Brandon was,
it seems quite certain, the executioner of
Charles I. Then followed Edward, commonly
known as Esquire Dun, and then the renowned
Jack Ketch, who went to his ghastly
work with so callous a disregard for human
suffering, or, as some fancied, with such
monstrous glee, that his name, becoming the
very synonym for hangman, clave to all his
successors. He &#8220;flourished&#8221; 1663-1686.
Dryden calls him an &#8220;excellent physician,&#8221;
and commemorates him more than once in
his full-resounding line. Some held Catch
his true patronymic and Ketch a corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of Jacquet, the family name of those who
held the Manor of Tyburn during a great
part of the seventeenth century, but this,
however ingenious, seems too far-fetched.
The original Jack was ungracious and surly
even beyond the manner of his kind. In
January 1686, for insolence to the sheriffs,
&#8220;he was deposed and committed to Bridewell.&#8221;
Pascha Rose, a butcher, succeeded
but getting himself hanged in May Ketch
was reinstated. It is recorded that he struck
for higher pay&mdash;and got it too. You might
fancy that any one could adjust the &#8220;Tyburn
Tippet,&#8221; or &#8220;the riding knot an inch below
the ear.&#8221; But the business called for its
own special knack. In the <i>History of the
Press-yard</i> the Hangman is represented, after
the suppression of the 1715 Rising, as cheerfully
expectant, &#8220;provided the king does not
unseasonably spoil my market by reprieves
and pardons.&#8221; He will receive ample douceurs
&#8220;for civility-money in placing their halters&#8217;
knot right under their left ear, and separating
their quarters with all imaginable decency.&#8221;
Ketch&#8217;s fancy hovered between a noble and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
highwayman. My Lord was never stingy with
tips; &#8217;twere unseasonable and quite against
the traditions of his order. And the foppery
of the other made him a bird worth plucking.
I do not pretend to give a complete
catalogue of these rascals, yet two others I
must mention: John Price (1718) was arrested
for murder as he was escorting, it is said, a
felon to Tyburn. It was a brutal business,
and he richly deserved the halter. He got
it too! John Dennis led the attack on
Newgate in the Lord George Gordon No-Popery
Riots (<i>temp.</i> 1780, but of course you
remember your <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>). He was
like to have swung himself, but was continued
in his old occupation on condition of stringing
up his fellow-rioters. Of old time the
Hangman was (we are assured) sworn on the
Book to dispatch every criminal without
favour to father or relative or friend; and
he was then dismissed with this formula:&mdash;&#8220;Get
thee hence, wretch.&#8221; I have noted the
unwillingness to admit him into Newgate&mdash;his
wages were paid over the gate&mdash;and the
sorry condition of his equipage. This last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
gave a grotesque touch to his progress,
readily seized on by the jeering mob, which
had ever a curse or a missile for the scowling
wretch.</p>

<p>In the centuries of its horrible virility, the
Tree at Tyburn slew its tens of thousands.
A record of famous cases would fill volumes.
I can but note a very few. The earliest
recorded, though they cannot have been the
first, were those of Judge Tressilian and
Nicholas Brembre, in February 1388. Their
offence was high treason, which meant in that
primitive time little more than a political
difference with the authorities. This
Brembre had been four times Mayor of
London. He proposed some startling innovations
in the city, one being to change its
name to New Troy (Geoffrey of Monmouth
perchance had turned his head). Here ended
Perkin Warbeck, that &#8220;little cockatrice
of a king&#8221; on whom Bacon lavishes such
wealth of vituperative rhetoric, after abusing
Henry VII.&#8217;s generosity more than once. The
savagery of Henry VIII. kept the executioner
busy, and he of Tyburn had his full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
share. On May 4, 1535, in open defiance
to every past tradition, the King caused
hang and quarter Haughton, the last prior
of the Charterhouse, in his sacerdotal robes,
without any previous ceremony of degradation,
after which &#8220;his arm was hung as a
bloody sign over the archway of the Charterhouse.&#8221;
In 1581, under Elizabeth, Campion
and Harte continued the long line of catholic
martyrs. Campion had been so cruelly
racked that he could not hold up his hand
to plead without assistance, yet he maintained
his courage through the raw December
morning whereon he suffered. At Tyburn
they vexed him with long discussions; but
at last, while he was yet praying for Elizabeth,
the cart drove away. Many of his
disciples stood round. They fought for
relics which the authorities were determined
they should not have, so that a young man
having dipped his handkerchief in the blood
was forthwith arrested. In the confusion
some one cut off a finger and conveyed it
away. Some one else offered twenty pounds
for a finger-joint, but the hangman dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
not let it go. The fevered imagination of
Campion&#8217;s adorers saw wondrous signs. Some
pause in the flow of the Thames was noted
on that day, and was ascribed thereto. The
river</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6">Awhile astonished stood</div>
<div class="verse">To count the drops of Campion&#8217;s sacred blood.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Campion himself had long a presentiment
of his fate, which, considering the desperate
nature of his mission, was not wonderful;
and when occasion took him past the Triple
Tree he was moved to uncover his head.
Southwell, the &#8220;sweet singer&#8221; of the Catholic
reaction, told the end of his friend in a little
work printed at Douay, but in English, and
of course for English circulation; and in
1595 Southwell followed his brother priest.
His followers noted that, when his heart was
torn out, &#8220;it leaped from the dissector&#8217;s
hand and, by its thrilling, seemed to repel
the flames.&#8221; A strange legend&mdash;not quite
baseless, Mr. Gardner thinks&mdash;shows the
effect of such scenes on the Catholic mind.
Henrietta Maria, Charles I.&#8217;s queen, walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
barefoot to Tyburn, as to a shrine, at dead
of night, and did penance under the gallows
for the sins of her adopted country. A
felon of a very different order was Mrs.
Turner, who suffered (November 14, 1615)
for complicity in Sir Thomas Overbury&#8217;s
murder. She had invented yellow starch,
and my Lord Coke with a fine sense of the
picturesque ordained her to hang &#8220;in her
yellow Tinny Ruff and Cuff.&#8221; She dressed
the part gallantly; &#8220;her face was highly
rouged, and she wore a cobweb lawn ruff,
yellow starched.&#8221; The Hangman had also
yellow bands and cuffs, he tied her hands
with a black silk ribbon herself had provided,
as well as a black veil for her face. Being
turned off, she seemed to die quietly. But
yellow starch went hopelessly out of fashion!</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the bodies of Cromwell,
Ireton, and Bradshaw were dug up at
Westminster, removed at night to the Red
Lion Inn, Holborn, drawn next morning
(January 30, 1661), the anniversary of
Charles&#8217;s death, to Tyburn, and there hanged
in their shrouds on the three wooden posts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the gallows. At nightfall they were
taken down and beheaded; the bodies being
there buried, whilst the heads adorned Westminster
Hall. Noll had his picturesque
historians before Carlyle. A wild tale arose
that his original funeral at the Abbey had
been but a mock ceremonial; for his body,
according to his own instructions, had been
secretly removed to Naseby, and buried at
nightfall on the scene of that victory. Even
if we disregard this legend, the subsequent
adventures of Cromwell&#8217;s head have been a
matter of as much concern to antiquaries
as ever the Royal Martyr&#8217;s was to Mr.
Dick.</p>

and even jovial exits of those &#8220;curled darlings&#8221;
of the <i>Tyburn Calendar or Malefactors&#8217;

imagination, the Caroline and Georgian

<p>How the mob bolted with Jack Sheppard&#8217;s
body (November 16, 1724) to save the
&#8220;bonny corp&#8221; from the surgeon&#8217;s knife!
How Jonathan Wild, &#8220;the Great&#8221; (May 24,
1725), during the finishing touches picked
the Ordinary&#8217;s pocket of his corkscrew, and
was turned off with it still in his hand
(thus Fielding: Purney was the ordinary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<i>His</i> account is quite different), to the unspeakable
delight of that enormous body of
spectators, to which Sheppard&#8217;s two hundred
thousand onlookers were (Defoe assures us)
no more to be compared than is a regiment
to an army. How Sixteen-string Jack
(November 30, 1774), his &#8220;bright pea-green
coat&#8221; and &#8220;immense nosegay&#8221; were almost
<i>too</i> magnificent even for so noble an occasion.
Alas! not ours to dwell on such details; let
the brave rogues go!</p>

<p>I cull one instance from the peerage.
Earl Ferrers suffered at Tyburn (May 5,
1760) for the death of Johnson, his land
steward. He dressed in his wedding clothes,
&#8220;a suit of white and silver&#8221;: &#8220;as good an
occasion,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;for putting them on,
as that for which they were first made&#8221; (his
treatment of his wife had indirectly brought
about the murder). Every consideration
was paid to my Lord&#8217;s feelings: &#8220;A landau
with six horses&#8221; was <i>his</i> Tyburn cart, and a
silk rope <i>his</i> &#8220;anodyne necklace&#8221;; and yet
things did not go smoothly. The mob was
so enormous that the journey took three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
hours. It was far worse than hanging, he
protested to the sheriffs. His very handsome
tip of five guineas was handed by mistake
to the Hangman&#8217;s man, and an unseemly
altercation ensued. My Lord toed the line
with anxious care. &#8220;Am I right?&#8221; were his
last words. The accurate fall of the drop
must have satisfied him that he was.</p>

<p>I must not neglect the clergy. Here the
leading case is obviously that of Dr. Dodd,
hanged for forgery (June 27, 1777). The
strange ups and down of his life (&#8220;he descended
so low as to become the editor of a
newspaper&#8221;) are not for this page. The
maudlin piety of his last days is no pleasant
spectacle. Dr. Newton, Bishop of Bristol,
thought him deserving of pity &#8220;because
hanged for the least crime he had committed.&#8221;
Dr. Samuel Johnson did all he could to save
him; also wrote his address to the judge (sentence
had been respited) in reply to the usual
question, as well as the sermon he delivered
in Newgate Chapel three weeks before the
end. The King sternly refused a reprieve.
No doubt he was right. The very manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of the deed seems to argue not a first, only
a first discovered, offence. His doggerel
<i>Thoughts in Prison</i> is his chief literary
crime. He went in a coach. His &#8220;considerable
time in praying,&#8221; and &#8220;several
showers of rain,&#8221; rendered the mob somewhat
impatient. He was assisted by two
clergymen. One was very much affected;
&#8220;the other, I suppose, was the Ordinary, as
he was perfectly indifferent and unfeeling in
everything he said and did.&#8221; Villette was
then Ordinary. He wrote an account (after
the most approved pattern) of Dodd&#8217;s unhappy
end. The pair had spent much time
together in Newgate, and one hopes the
report of Villette&#8217;s behaviour is mistaken or
inaccurate, though it is that of an eye-witness,
a correspondent of George Selwyn himself
an enthusiastic amateur of executions,
who, when he had a tooth drawn, let fall his
handkerchief <i>à la Tyburn</i>, as a signal for the
operation. James Boswell had a like craze.
He went in a mourning coach with the Rev.
James Hackman when that divine was
hanged (April 19, 1779) for the murder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Miss Reay. When Hackman let fall the
handkerchief for signal it fell <i>outside</i> the
cart, and Ketch with an eye to small
perquisites jumped down to secure it <i>before</i>
he whipped up the horse. These are all
names more or less known. There are
hundreds of curious incidents connected with
obscure deaths. Here are a few samples:&mdash;In
1598 &#8220;some mad knaves took tobacco
all the way as they went to be hanged at
Tyburn.&#8221; In 1677, a woman and &#8220;a little
dog ten inches high&#8221; were hanged side by
side as accomplices&mdash;&#8220;a hideous prospect,&#8221;
comments our chronicler. In 1684 Francis
Kirk, having murdered his wife, must end at
Tyburn. Shortly before he had seen a fellow
hanged there for making away with <i>his</i>
spouse; and this, he confessed, had inspired
him!</p>

<p>One John Austin had the distinction of
being the last person executed at Tyburn
(November 7, 1783). Reformers had long
denounced the procession as a public scandal.
The sheriffs had some doubts as to their
powers; but the judges, being consulted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
assured them they could end it an they
would. A month after (December 9,
1783) the gallows was at work in front of
Newgate, and Old London lost its most
exciting spectacle. Dr. Johnson frankly
regretted the change:&mdash;&#8220;Executions are intended
to draw spectators, if they do not
draw spectators they lose their reason. The
old method was more satisfactory to all
parties. The public was gratified by a procession,
the criminal was supported by it.
Why is all this to be swept away?&#8221; In
truth, the change of scene was an illogical
compromise: the picturesque effect was gone&mdash;save
for an occasional touch, as after
Holling&#8217;s execution, when the dead hand was
thrust into a woman&#8217;s bosom, to remove a
mark or wen&mdash;the disorderly mob remained,
nay, was a greater scandal at the centre than
in the suburbs. Dickens is but one of many
writers who knowing their London well
described the unedifying walk and talk of
the crowd before Newgate; and in 1868
private was substituted for public execution
throughout the land. I do not criticise any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
system: I do but point out that of the two
sets of opposing forces noted as working on
the criminal&#8217;s mind, the latter, in a private
execution, is entirely suppressed.</p>

<p>Tyburn and its memories, its criminals, its
Hangmen, its Ordinaries, filled a great space
in popular imagination, and have frequent
mention in our great writers. Shakespeare
himself has &#8220;The shape of Love&#8217;s Tyburn&#8221;;
and Dryden&#8217;s &#8220;Like thief and parson in a
Tyburn cart&#8221; is a stock quotation. But I
cannot string a chaplet of these pearls. Yet
two phrases I must explain. A felon who
&#8220;prayed his clergy&#8221; was during some centuries
branded on the crown of his thumb with the
letter T, ere he was released, to prevent a
second use of the plea. This was called, in
popular slang, the Tyburn T. Ben Jonson
was so branded (October, 1598) for killing
Gabriel Spencer, the actor, in a duel. Again
a statute of 1698 (10 Will. III. c. 12), provided
for those who prosecuted a felon to
conviction a certificate freeing them from
certain parochial duties. This was known as
a &#8220;Tyburn ticket.&#8221; It had a certain money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
value, because if unused it could be assigned
once. The privilege was abolished in 1827
(7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 27), but it was allowed
as late as 1856 to a certain Mr. Pratt, of
Bond Street, who by showing his ticket
(which must have been thirty years old)
escaped service on an Old Bailey jury.</p>

and Baker&mdash;Brawler and Scold&mdash;Fraudulent
Attorneys&mdash;End of the Pillory and of Public

Tale of a Cart&mdash;Some Lesser Sufferers.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Hood</span> has comically told of his pretended
experiences in the Pillory:&mdash;&#8220;It is a sort of
Egg-Premiership: a place above your fellows,
but a place which you have on trial. You
are not without the established political vice,
for you are not exempt from turning,&#8221;&mdash;with
more punning cogitations of a like nature.
Of rarer humour is Charles Lamb&#8217;s <i>Reflections
in the Pillory</i>, with its invocation to them
that once stood therein:&mdash;&#8220;Shades of Bastwick
and of Prynne hover over thee&mdash;Defoe
is there, and more greatly daring Shebbeare&mdash;from
their (little more elevated) stations
they look down with recognitions. Ketch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
turn me!&#8221; A century or so earlier these
ingenious wits had possibly stood therein&mdash;in
fact and not in fancy. It was a way our
old-time rulers had of rewarding ingenious
wits. And not wits alone: since for many
centuries it was in daily use throughout the
length and breadth of Merrie England.</p>

<p>Our treatment of crime is the exact opposite
of our forefathers&#8217;. Our criminal toils,
is flogged, is hanged in private; the old idea
was to make punishment as public as possible,
for so penalty and effect (it was thought)
were heightened and increased. The Pillory
was the completest expression of this idea.
A man was exposed for sixty minutes in the
market-place at the busiest hour of the day,
and the public itself was summoned to
approve of and aid the punishment. The
thing was known in old Saxon days. In the
laws of Withred it is called <i>healsfang</i>. The
mediæval Latin name for it was <i>collistrigium</i>.
Both terms = a &#8220;catch for the neck.&#8221; Its
form varied. The simplest was a wooden
frame or screen, with three holes in it, elevated
some feet above the ground. The culprit stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
behind upon a platform, his head and hands
caught in and stuck through the aforesaid
holes. This was much like the stocks, save
that there the patient sat instead of stood
and had his feet enclosed instead of his head
and hands. In popular phrase this was &#8220;to
peep through the nut-crackers.&#8221; Again, the
structure swung on a pivot; so that the
inmate might face the compass points in
turn. Sometimes, though this was rather a
foreign fashion, it was so commodious that it
would take a nosegay of twelve; at the same
time that it went revolving and revolving&mdash;a
very far from merry-go-round! Now (as
at Dublin) it was the kernel of a large and
imposing structure of stone. Now (as at
Coleshill, in Warwickshire) it stood a deft
arrangements of uprights, boards, and holes,
and did triple duty&mdash;as stocks, as whipping-post,
as Pillory. Now, yet again (as at
Marlborough, in Wiltshire), the frame turned
on a swivel at the will of the patient, whose
deft twistings in dodging missiles hugely
delighted the grinning mob. With pen and
pencil Mr. Llewellyn Jewitt and other antiquarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
have preserved for our delectation
yet other forms.</p>

<p>The Pillory was first used for dishonest
bakers, brewers, corn-sellers, and the like.
Then, its offices were extended to divers
kinds of misdemeanants. Later, it was the
lot of your scurrile pamphleteer, your libeller,
and your publisher of unlicensed volumes.
The victim was not always pelted; for feeling
might run high against the Government; and
when he was acclaimed his shame became
his glory. So the thing served as a weather-glass
of popular opinion.</p>

<p>I turn to some historic instances. Under
Henry III., by the Assize of Bread and Ale,
it was decreed that knavish bakers, brewers,
and butchers be &#8220;set on the pyllory.&#8221; It
was also provided that &#8220;The pyllory shal be
of a metely strengthe, so that they that be
fautye may be thereon without any jeopardye
of their lyvys.&#8221; (The platform must not
seldom have broken down, leaving the &#8220;worm
of the hour&#8221; suspended by the neck&mdash;that
had been securely fastened&mdash;in peril of
strangulation, in a case of this sort, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Elizabeth, he sued the town, and recovered
damages.) The articles of usage for the
City of London, published under Edward I.,
set forth some evil humours of the time.
Rustical simplicity fell, then as now, an
easy prey to urban cunning. What rascals
these mediæval cits were, to be sure! Thus,
your corn dealer would take in grain from
harmless necessary bumpkins, to whom he
would give an earnest, telling them to come
to his house for payment. Here he met
them with a long face:&mdash;his wife had gone
out with the key of the cash-box; would his
country friends call again? And when they
do, he is &#8220;not in.&#8221; (Ah! That &#8220;call
again&#8221; and that &#8220;not in!&#8221; Were they
stale so many centuries ago?) If the rogue
were discovered, he impudently denied his
debt:&mdash;he had never seen the gentlemen
before; or, raising some dispute about the
price, he told him to take back his goods&mdash;when
the corn was found too wet for removal.
&#8220;By these means the poor men lose half
their pay in expenses before they are settled
with;&#8221; and the wrong-doer is to be amerced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
heavily. Being unable to pay, &#8220;then he
shall be put on the Pillory, and remain there
an hour in the day at least; a Serjeant of
the City standing by the side of the Pillory
with good hue-and-cry as to the reason why
he is punished.&#8221; The wicked butcher suffered
after the same fashion; while the baker, who
put off bad bread, was drawn&mdash;for the first
offence upon a hurdle from the Guildhall to
his own house, by &#8220;the great streets that
are most dirty, with the faulty loaf hanging
about his neck,&#8221; a spectacle to gods and a
cockshy for men. For the second offence he
processioned as before; and, to boot, he
must stand in the Pillory for an hour.
Offending for the third time, he was judged
incorrigible: his oven was dismantled, and
he might bake within the city bounds no
more. Sure, the ancient London loaf, be it
<i>manchet</i>, or <i>chete</i>, or mere <i>mystelon</i>, must
ever have been of good quality? When,
indeed, did the falling off begin? Was it
when the city fathers unwisely took to
regulating men&#8217;s morals? In the seventh of
Richard II. this punishment was ordained for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the man of evil life:&mdash;&#8220;Let his head and
beard be shaved except a fringe on the head
two inches in breadth, and let him be taken
to the Pillory, with minstrels, and set thereon
for a certain time, at the discretion of the
Mayor and Aldermen.&#8221; As for the erring
sister, she was taken from the prison into
Aldgate with a hood of ray and a white
wand in her hand. From Aldgate minstrels
played her to the Thew (a species of Pillory
for women). Thence, her offence being proclaimed,
she was led &#8220;through Chepe and
Newgate to Cokkes Lane, there to take up
her abode.&#8221; Again, the brawler or the scold
must hold a distaff with tow in hand&mdash;and
so on; for your old-time law-giver lusted
after variation.</p>

<p>Once the Pillory was an indispensable
ornament of the market-place. Nay, were it
not kept fit for use, the very right to hold a
market might be lost. As an emblem of
power, it was claimed by the great lords:
often, indeed, it went with the lordship of
the manor. Thus at Beverley, in the
twenty-first of Edward I., John, Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of York, claims the right of Pillory with the
right of gallows and gibbet; and with the
right of Pillory the right of tumbrell, which
was the dung-cart wherein minor malefactors
were shamefully trundled through the town.
Legislative ingenuity was ever striving to
devise fresh marks of ignominy. Stow relates
that, in the seventh of Edward IV., certain
common jurors must (for their partial
conduct) ride in paper mitres from Newgate
to the Pillory in Cornhill, and there do
penance for their fault. Again, in the first
of Henry VIII. (1509), Smith and Simpson,
ringleaders of false inquests, rode the City
(also in paper mitres) with their faces to the
horse&#8217;s tail; and they were set on the Pillory
in Cornhill; and they were brought again to
Newgate, where they died from very shame.
The like fate, it seems, befell a much later
offender, one James Morris, who was pilloried
(April 2, 1803) for fraud in the market
place at Lancaster. Next morning he was
found dead in his bed, and the coroner&#8217;s jury
brought it in as &#8220;visitation of God.&#8221; Oft-times
the sufferer came less mysteriously to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
his end. The mobility was, in effect, invited,
as it were, to italicise his sentence in terms
of anything you please, from rotten eggs to
brickbats. Not seldom it did so to the
sternest purpose. On June 22, 1732, contemporary
prints report:&mdash;&#8220;Last night the
corpse of John Walker, who was killed in
the Pillory on Tuesday last, was buried at
St. Andrew&#8217;s, Holborn;&#8221; and among the
casualties of the December of that same year,
the case of another poor wretch is dismissed
with &#8220;murder&#8217;d in the pillory.&#8221; In 1756
Egon and two others were pilloried for procuring
the commission of a robbery, in order
to get a reward for its detection. Egon was
stoned to death. On one or two occasions&mdash;notably
when Elizabeth Collier was pilloried
by order of Jeffreys in 1680&mdash;the authorities
were ordered to see that the peace was kept and
that the culprit suffered the exposure alone.</p>

<p>A long list might be given of misdemeanours
punished by the Pillory:&mdash;as, practising
the art magick; cutting a purse; placing a
piece of iron in a loaf of bread; selling bad
oats, stinking eels, strawberry pottles half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
fall of fern; vending ale by measures not
sealed and thickening the bottom of such
measures with pewter. As (also) lies, defamations,
and libels of all sorts. If the lie
were notorious, or were told of the mayor
or any other dignitary, the liar was pilloried
with a whetstone round his neck: whence
it came that a whetstone was the popular
reward for audacious mendacity, and &#8220;lying
for the whetstone&#8221; was a current phrase.</p>

<p>Late Tudor and Stuart times edged and
weighted the punishment of the Pillory. It
might be preceded by a flogging at the Cart&#8217;s-tail.
Stripped to the waist, the culprit, man
or woman, was tied to the hinder end (our
fathers used a shorter phrase) of a cart,
and was thus lashed through the streets.
(This vulgarly was called, &#8220;Shoving the
tumbler,&#8221; or &#8220;Crying carrots and turnips.&#8221;)
Or, as Butler&#8217;s couplet reminds us, the
patient&#8217;s ears were nailed to the wood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Each window like a Pillory appears,</div>
<div class="verse">With heads thrust through, nail&#8217;d by the ears.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Or his ears were cropped, and not seldom his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
nose was slit likewise. In 1570, Timothy
Penredd was pilloried in Chepe on two successive
market-days for counterfeiting the
seal of the Queen&#8217;s Bench. Each time an
ear was nailed; and this poor member he
must free &#8220;by his own proper motion.&#8221; If
the wrench were too great for human fortitude,
the thoughtful authorities lent some aid.
In one case (1552) the culprit would not &#8220;rent
his eare&#8221;; so that in the long run &#8220;one of
the bedles slitted yt upwards with a penkniffe
to loose it.&#8221; Indeed, the law had a strong
grudge against the ears of malefactors. The
fourteenth of Elizabeth, cap. 5, ordered that
vagrants be grievously whipped and burned
through the gristle of the right ear, unless
some credible person took them to service (if
they relapsed they were hanged). The punishments
of the time show a curious alternation
between Pillory and Cart. Thus, whilst
keepers of immoral houses were carted about
the town to the music of ringing basins, in
the eleventh of James I., William Barnwell,
&#8220;gentleman&#8221; (an inaccurate description had
vitiated the indictment), and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Thomasina, criminals of the same class, were
whipped at the Cart&#8217;s-tail from the prison to
their house, and back again. Thus, too, were
handled those who lived by cards and dice; but,
for witchcraft, Dorothy Magicke was set four
times a year upon the Pillory, and must thereon
make public confession. This man capers dolefully
at the Cart&#8217;s-tail for stealing lead; that
must take his turn in the Pillory for snatching
three-pence worth of hairs from a mare&#8217;s
tail. Later, it was thought excellent
for fraudulent attorneys. In November
1786 one &#8220;Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; (the name is thus
disguised), a legal gentleman, was brought
from Newgate in a hackney cab and pilloried
for an hour hard by the gate of Westminster
Hall. What he did, and how he fared, we
are not told; so it may be that his hap was
even as Thomas Scott&#8217;s, pilloried for a false
accusation in January 1804. Scott was
pelted with rotten eggs, filth, and dirt of the
street. Also, the neighbouring ragamuffins
had thoughtfully collected good store of
dead cats and rats &#8220;in the vicinity of the
metropolis&#8221; that morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Was it so very edifying after all? Opinions
began to differ. Yet Lord Thurlow solemnly
cracked it up &#8220;as a restraint against licentiousness
provided by the wisdom of our
ancestors&#8221;; and in 1814 Lord Ellenborough
ordered Lord Cochrane to be pilloried for
conspiring to spread false news. The justice
of this last abominable sentence was questioned.
Sir Francis Burdett, Cochrane&#8217;s
fellow-member for Middlesex, vowed that he
would stand with him on the day of punishment;
but the Government did not venture
to carry out the sentence. Two years later,
in 1816, the punishment of Pillory was
restricted to persons guilty of perjury; and
in 1837, by the 1 Vict. cap. 23, it was
abolished altogether. The last person who
suffered it is said to have been Peter James
Bossy, pilloried in front of the Old Bailey,
June 24, 1830. The public whipping of
women went in 1817; the private followed
in 1820 by 1 Geo. IV. cap. 57. The
whipping of men for a common law misdemeanour
has never been formally abolished;
but the punishment is now inflicted only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
under the Garrotters Act (1863) for robbery
with violence; which, of course, has nothing
to do with existing statutory provisions for
the flogging of juvenile male offenders. I
should add that in America Pillory and
Whipping-Post were &#8220;an unconscionable
time a-dying&#8221;; lingered especially in the
State of Delaware; and that their restoration
has been urged.</p>

<p>The Finger Pillory deserves a word. It
was fixed up inside churches (that of Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
for instance) and halls. Boys
who misbehaved during service, and offenders
at festive times against the mock reign of
the lord of misrule, alike expiated their
offences therein.</p>

<p>I note some remarkable cases. First, and
most important, is the group of literary
martyrs. The Stuart Government could not
crush the press; but author, printer, and
publisher all worked in peril of the Pillory.
The author of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> was, perhaps,
its most famous inmate.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Earless on high stood unabash&#8217;d De Foe,</div>
<div class="verse">And Tutchin flagrant from the scourge below,</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>sings Pope in the <i>Dunciad</i> with reckless inaccuracy.
In 1703, De Foe, for his <i>Shortest
Way with the Dissenters</i>, was condemned to
stand thrice in the Pillory before the Royal
Exchange, near the Conduit in Cheapside,
and at Temple Bar. The mob, he tells us,
treated him very well, and cheered long and
loud when he was taken out of what he calls
a &#8220;Hieraglyphick state machine; Contrived
to punish fancy in&#8221; (<i>Hymn to the Pillory</i>).
He comforts himself by reflecting that the
learned Selden narrowly escaped it, and turns
the whole thing to ridicule; but then mutilation
was no port of the sentence. Pope&#8217;s
reference to John Tutchin is still wider of the
mark. Tutchin, having narrowly escaped
death for his share in Monmouth&#8217;s rebellion,
was sentenced by Jeffreys, on his famous
Western Circuit (1685), to seven years&#8217; imprisonment,
during which he must, once a
year, be whipped through every market-town
in Dorsetshire. The very clerk of the court
was moved to protest that this meant a
whipping once a fortnight; but the sentence
remained. Out of bravado, or in desperation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the prisoner petitioned the King to be hanged
instead of whipped; but, in the result, he
was neither whipped nor hanged. He fell
ill of the small-pox; passion cooled; and,
intelligently bribing, he escaped, to visit
Jeffreys in the Tower. Apparently he went
to gloat, but remained to accept the ruined
Chancellor&#8217;s explanation, that he had only
obeyed instructions. &#8220;So after he had
treated Mr. <i>Tutchin</i> with a glass of wine,
Mr. <i>Tutchin</i> went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another of Pope&#8217;s examples is &#8220;old
Prynne,&#8221; cropped (in 1632) in the Pillory
for his <i>Histriomastic</i>, or Players&#8217; Scourge,
which was held to reflect on Charles I.&#8217;s
Queen. Again he stood there in 1637,
when the executioner cruelly mangled the
ancient stumps. A quite incorrigible person
was this same William Prynne, described by
Marchmont Needham as &#8220;one of the greatest
paper worms that ever crept about a library.&#8221;
He wrote some forty works remarkable for
virulence even in that age of bitter polemics.
He strenuously supported the Restoration,
and the new Government was at its wit&#8217;s end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
what to do with him till Charles himself
solved the difficulty with happy humour.
&#8220;Let him amuse himself with writing against
the Catholics and poring over the records in
the Tower,&#8221; said the king; and silenced him
with the Keepership of the Records and
£500 a year. Prynne&#8217;s second appearance
was for a bitter attack on Laud; and he had
as fellow-sufferers John Bastwick, who had
written a sort of mock <i>Litanie</i>, and Henry
Burton. Bastwick was &#8220;very merrie.&#8221; His
wife &#8220;got on a stool and kissed him;&#8221; and,
&#8220;his ears being cut off, she called for them,
put them in a clean handkerchief, and carried
them away with her.&#8221; There was a great
crowd, which &#8220;cried and howled terribly,
especially when Burton was cropped.&#8221; Being
angered by the jeers and execrations of the
mob, the executioner did his work very
brutally. Pope&#8217;s Billingsgate is classic, but
it remains Billingsgate. The Pillory shows
often in his verse. Edmund Curl was a pet
aversion of his, and for publishing the
<i>Memoirs of Ker of Kersland</i> Curl suffered
the punishment at Charing Cross on Feb. 23,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
1728. Pope hints (<i>Dunciad</i>, II. 3 and 4) that
he was badly handled by the mob. In truth
he came off very well, owing, it seems, to an
explanatory circular he got distributed among
the spectators.</p>

<p>As time wore on the punishment reverted
to its earlier and milder form. Thus, in
1630, Dr. Leighton, for his <i>Zion&#8217;s Plea
against Prelacy</i>, was pilloried, branded,
cropped, and whipped; but the authors of
the eighteenth century were punished by
exposure alone, and were often solaced by
popular sympathy. In 1765 Williams, the
bookseller, stood in the Pillory for re-publishing
<i>The North Briton</i>: he held a sprig
of laurel in his hand, and a large collection
was made for him then and there. In derision
of authority the mob displayed (<i>inter
alia</i>) the famous Bootjack&mdash;the popular
reference to Lord Bute, the late Prime
Minister. Still more farcical was the exposure
(1759) of Dr. Shebbeare for publishing
political libels. He was attended on the
platform by a servant in livery holding an
umbrella over his head, and his neck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
arms were not confined. The court thought
the under-sheriff of Middlesex something
more than remiss: wherefore he was fined
and imprisoned, it being judicially decided
that the culprit must stand not merely <i>on</i>
but <i>in</i> the Pillory. In this connexion I will
only further mention the case of Eton the
publisher, &#8220;a very old man,&#8221; who in 1812
was pilloried for printing Paine&#8217;s <i>Age of
Reason</i>. Here, again, the crowd, by the
respect it heaped upon the prisoner, altogether
eliminated the sting from the punishment.
The minor scribe of to-day is
supposed to court an action, nay, a criminal
prosecution, as a stimulus to circulation; a
former age saw in the Pillory the best possible
advertisement for the Grub Street hack. In
Foote&#8217;s <i>Patron</i>, Puff, the publisher, urges
Dactyl to produce a satire; and, when the
proposed risk is hinted at, retorts: &#8220;Why,
I would not give twopence for an author who
was afraid of his ears.... Why, zooks,
sir! I never got salt for my porridge till I
mounted at the Royal Exchange, that was
the making of me.... The true Castalian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
stream is a shower of eggs and a Pillory the
poet&#8217;s Parnassus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among cases other than literary, a notable
one is that of Titus Oates (1685), who, being
convicted of perjury, was sentenced to stand
in the Pillory and be whipped at the Cart&#8217;s-tail.
The lashing was so cruelly done that
you feel some pity even for that arch rascal.
The curious computed that he received 2256
strokes with a whip of six thongs&mdash;13,536
strokes in all. Yet the wretch lived to enjoy
a pension after the Revolution! There was
another remarkable instance that same year.
Thomas Dangerfield, convicted of libelling
the King when Duke of York, was sentenced
to a fine, to the Pillory, and to be whipped
from Aldgate to Newgate, and from Newgate
to Tyburn. The dreadful work was
over, and he was returning prisonwards in a
coach, when there steps forward Robert
Francis, a barrister of Gray&#8217;s Inn, with the
cruel jibe, &#8220;How now, friend? Have you
had your heat this morning?&#8221; Dangerfield
turned on him with bitter curses (&#8220;Son of a
wh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; is the elegant sample preserved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the records). Francis, much enraged, thrust
at the aching, smarting, bleeding wretch with
a small cane, and by mischance put out an
eye, so that in two hours Dangerfield was
dead; and no great while thereafter he himself
was tried, condemned, and hanged. According
to the testimony of the Rev. Mr. Samuel
Smith, Ordinary at Newgate, he made a very
edifying end.</p>

<p>Quite interesting is the case of Japhet
Crook, <i>alias</i> Sir Peter Stringer, whose unhappy
memory is preserved in some of Pope&#8217;s
most biting lines. In 1731, poor Japhet
stood in the Pillory at Charing Cross for
forging a deed; when the hangman, dressed
like a butcher, &#8220;with a knife like a gardener&#8217;s
pruning knife cut off his ears, and with a pair
of scissors slit both his nostrils.&#8221; The
wretch endured all this with great patience;
but at the searing &#8220;the pain was so great
that he got up from his chair.&#8221; No wonder!
Two years after Eleanor Beare, keeper of
&#8220;The White Horse,&#8221; Nuns Green, Derby,
was pilloried (August 1732) after just
escaping the gallows for murder. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
mounted the platform &#8220;with an easy air&#8221;;
thus exasperating a mob already ill-disposed,
which bombarded her with apples,
eggs, turnips, and so forth; so that &#8220;the
stagnate kennels were robbed of their contents,
and became the cleanest part of the
street.&#8221; Managing to escape, she dashed off,
&#8220;a moving heap of filth,&#8221; but was presently
seized and lugged back; and at the end of
the hour she was carried to prison, &#8220;an object
which none cared to touch.&#8221; A week after
she was again forced to take her stand. The
officer noted that her head was wondrous
swelled, and he presently stripped it of &#8220;ten
or twelve coverings,&#8221; whereof one was a
pewter plate. Her aspect was most forlorn,
but the crowd, no whit moved, pelted its
hardest, and she was borne away more dead
than alive. Yet she too not only lived, but
&#8220;recovered her health, her spirits, and her
beauty.&#8221; Two lighter instances, and I have
done. In the early stages of Monmouth&#8217;s
rebellion, an astrologer, consulting the stars,
saw that the duke would be presently King of
England. After Sedgemoor he was cast into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Dorchester Gaol for this unlucky prediction.
Again falling to his observations, he clearly
read &#8220;that he would be whipped at the
Cart&#8217;s &mdash;&mdash;&#8221;; and this time the planets
spoke true. In 1783, the poet Cowper
reports one humorous case from his own
experience. At Olney a man was publicly
whipped for theft; he whealed with every
stroke; but that was only because the beadle
drew the scourge against a piece of red ochre
hidden in his hand. Noting the fraud, the
parish constable laid his cane smartly about
the shoulders of the all too-lenient official,
whereat a country wench, in high dudgeon,
set to pomelling the constable. And of the
three the thief alone escaped punishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I propose</span> to examine the Witchcraft cases
in Howell&#8217;s twenty-one bulky volumes of
State Trials. The general subject, even in
England, is too vast for detailed treatment
here; also it is choked with all manner of
absurdities. In a trial some of these are
pared away: you know what the people saw,
or believed they saw, and you have the
declarations of the witches themselves. Only
five cases, all between 1616 (13 Jac. I.) and
1702 (1 Anne) are reported. The selection
is capricious, for some famous prosecutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
as that of the Lancashire witches are omitted,
but it is fairly representative.</p>

<p>In the early times Witchcraft and sorcery
were left to the Church. In 1541, 33 Hen.
VIII. c. 8, made both felony without &#8220;benefit
of clergy;&#8221; and by the 1 Jac. I. c. 12, all
persons invoking any evil spirit, or taking up
dead bodies from their graves to be used in
any Witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment,
or killing or otherwise hurting any
person by such infernal arts, shall be guilty
of felony without &#8220;benefit of clergy,&#8221; and
suffer death. King James&#8217;s views on Witchcraft
and his skill (whereon he greatly plumed
himself) as witch-finder are famed. Royal
influence went hand-in-hand with popular
superstition. In less than a century and a
half, legislative if not vulgar ideas were
altered, and in 1736, by 9 Geo. II. c. 5, the
laws against Witchcraft were swept away,
though charlatans professing the occult
sciences were still punished as cheats.</p>

<p>I pass as of little interest Howell&#8217;s first
case, that of Mary Smith, in 1616. More
worthy of note are the proceedings against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the Essex witches, some twenty in number,
condemned at the Chelmsford Sessions on
July 29, 1645, before the Earl of Warwick
and other Justices. One noted witch
was Elizabeth Clarke to whom the devil
had appeared &#8220;in the shape of a proper
gentleman with a laced band, having the
whole proportion of a man.&#8221; She had certain
imps, whom she called Jamara (&#8220;a
white dogge with red spots&#8221;), Vinegar Tom,
Hoult, and Sack and Sugar. So far the information
of Matthew Hopkins, of Manningtree,
gent., who further said that the same
evening whereon the accused confessed those
marvels to him, &#8220;he espied a white thing
about the bignesse of a kitlyn,&#8221; which bit a
piece out of his greyhound, and in his own
yard that very night &#8220;he espied a black
thing proportioned like a cat, only it was
thrice as big, sitting on a strawberry-bed, and
fixing the eyes on this informant.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Sterne, gent., had equal wonders of
imps the size of small dogs, and how Sack
and Sugar were like to do him hurt. &#8217;Twere
well, said the malevolent Elizabeth, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
this informant were so quick, otherwise the
said impe had soone skipped upon his face,
and perchance had got into his throate, and
then there would have been a feast of toades
in this informant&#8217;s belly.&#8221; The witch
Clarke ascribed her undoing to Anne Weste,
widow, here usually called Old Beldam Weste,
who, coming upon her as she was picking up
a few sticks, and seeming to pity her for
&#8220;her lamenesse (having but one leg) and her
poverty,&#8221; promised to send her a little kitten
to assist her. Sure enough, a few nights
after two imps appeared, who vowed to
&#8220;help her to an husband who should maintain
her ever after.&#8221; A country justice&#8217;s
notions of evidence are not supposed to be
exact even to-day; what they were then let
the information of Robert Tayler, also of
Manningtree, show. It seems Clarke had
accused one Elizabeth Gooding as a confederate.
Gooding was refused credit at
Tayler&#8217;s for half a pound of cheese, whereupon
&#8220;she went away muttering and
mumbling to herself, and within a few hours
came again with money and bought a pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of cheese of this informant.&#8221; That very
night Tayler&#8217;s horse fell grievously ill and
four farriers were gravelled to tell what ailed
it, but this portentous fact was noted: &#8220;the
belly of the said horse would rumble and
make a noyse as a foule chimney set on fire.&#8221;
In four days it was dead. Tayler had also
heard that certain confessed witches had
&#8220;impeached the said Elizabeth Gooding
for killing of this said horse,&#8221; moreover
Elizabeth kept company with notorious
witches&mdash;after which scepticism was scarce
permissible. Rebecca Weste, a prisoner
awaiting trial in Colchester, confessed how
at a witches&#8217; meeting the devil appeared
to her in the shape of a dog and kissed her.
In less than six months he came again and
promised to marry her. &#8220;Shee said he
kissed her, but was as cold as clay, and
married her that night in this manner: he
tooke her by the hand and led her about the
chamber and promised to be a loving husband
to death, and to avenge her of her
enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>One Rawbood had taken a house over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the head of Margaret Moon, another of the
accused, with highly unpleasant consequences.
Thus, Mrs. Rawbood, though a &#8220;very tydy
and cleanly woman, sitting upon a block,
after dinner with another neighbour, a little
before it was time to go to church upon an
Easter Day, the said Rawbood&#8217;s wife was on
a sudden so filled with lice that they might
have been swept off her clothes with a stick;
and this informant saith he did see them,
and that they were long and lean, and not
like other lice.&#8221; More gruesome were the
confessions of Rebecca Jones, of Osyth. One
fine day some twenty-five years past she, a
servant lass at Much-Clacton, was summoned
by a knock at the door, where she saw &#8220;a
very handsome young man, as shee then
thought, but now shee thinks it was the
devil.&#8221; Politely inquiring how she did, he
desired to see her left wrist, which being
shown him, he pulled out a pin &#8220;from this
examinant&#8217;s owne sleeve, and pricked her
wrist twice, and there came out a drop of
bloud, which he took off with the top of
his finger, and so departed&#8221;&mdash;leaving poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Rebecca&#8217;s heart all in a flutter. About four
months afterwards as she was going to
market to sell butter, a &#8220;man met with her,
being in a ragged state, and having such
great eyes that this examinant was very
much afraid of him.&#8221; He presented her
with three things like to &#8220;moules,&#8221; which
she afterwards used to destroy her neighbours&#8217;
cattle, and now and again her neighbours
themselves. In evidence against other
suspects there was mention of a familiar
called Elimanzer, who was fed with milk pottage,
and of imps called Wynowe, Jeso, Panu,
with many other remarkable particulars.</p>

<p>The foregoing was collected before trial
as information upon oath; but this testimony
of Sir Thomas Bowes, knight, was
given from the bench during the trial
of Anne Weste, whom it concerned. He
reported that an honest man of Manningtree
passing Anne Weste&#8217;s door at the very
witching hour of night, in bright moonlight
saw four things like black rabbits emerge.
He caught one of them, and beat the head
of it against his stick, &#8220;intending to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
out the braines of it,&#8221; failing in which benevolent
design, he next tried to tear off its
head, &#8220;and as he wrung and stretched the
neck of it, it came out between his hands
like a lock of wooll;&#8221; then he went to a
spring to drown it, but at every step he fell
down, yet he managed to creep to the water,
under which he held the thing &#8220;a good
space.&#8221; Thinking it was drowned he let go,
whereupon &#8220;it sprang out of the water into
the aire, and so vanished away.&#8221; There was
but one end possible for people who froze
the rustic soul with such pranks. Each and
all were soon dangling from the gallows.</p>

<p>The case of the Devon witches tried at
Exeter in August 1682 is much like the
Essex business. The informations are stuffed
with grotesque horrors, yet it is hard to
believe that the accused&mdash;three poor women
from Bideford, two of them widows&mdash;had
been convicted but for their own confessions,
which are full of copious and minute details
of their dealings with Satan. Going to
their death, they were worried by Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;,
a nonconformist preacher and (as is evident)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a very pestilent fellow. &#8220;Did you pass
through the keyhole of the door, or was the
door open?&#8221; was one query. The witch
asserted that like other people she entered
by the door, though &#8220;the devil did lead me
upstairs.&#8221; Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; went on, &#8220;How do
you know it was the devil?&#8221; &#8220;I knew it by
his eyes,&#8221; she returned. Again, &#8220;Did you
never ride over an arm of the sea on a cow?&#8221;&mdash;an
exploit which the poor woman sturdily
disclaimed. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, a little dissatisfied,
one fancies, prayed at them a while, after
which two of the women were turned off the
ladder. Mr. Sheriff tried his hand at the
survivor: he was curious as to the shape or
colour of the devil, and was answered that
he appeared &#8220;in black like a bullock.&#8221; He
again pressed her as to whether she went in
&#8220;through the keyhole or the door,&#8221; but she
alleged the more commonplace and (for a
witch) unorthodox mode of entry, &#8220;and so
was executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between these two cases one occurred
wherein the best legal intellect of the day
was engaged&mdash;and with no better result. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
March 1665, Rose Cullender and Amy Duny,
widows, were indicted at the Assizes at Bury
St. Edmunds for bewitching certain people.
Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Baron of the
Exchequer, presided. &#8220;Still his name is of
account.&#8221; To an earlier time he seemed a
judge &#8220;whom for his integrity, learning, and
law, hardly any age, either before or since,
could parallel.&#8221; William Durant, an infant,
was one victim; his mother had promised
Amy Duny a penny to watch him, but she
was strictly charged not to give him suck.
To what end? queried the court reflecting
on Amy&#8217;s age. The mother replied: firstly,
Amy had the reputation of a witch, and
secondly, it was a custom of old women thus
to please the child, &#8220;and it did please the
child, but it sucked nothing but wind, which
did the child hurt.&#8221; The two women had a
quarrel on the subject: Amy was enraged,
and departed after some dark sayings, and
the boy forthwith fell into &#8220;strange fits of
swounding.&#8221; Dr. Jacob, of Yarmouth, an
eminent witch-doctor, advised &#8220;to hang up
the child&#8217;s blanket in the chimney-corner all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
day, and at night when she put the child to
bed to put it into the said blanket, and if
she found anything in it she should not be
afraid, but throw it into the fire.&#8221; The
blanket was duly hung up, and taken down,
when a great toad fell out, which being
thrown into the fire made (not unnaturally)
&#8220;a great and horrible noise;&#8221; followed a
crack and a flash, and&mdash;exit the toad! The
court with solemn foolishness inquired if the
substance of the toad was not seen to consume?
and was stoutly answered &#8220;No.&#8221;
Next day Amy was discovered sitting alone
in her house in her smock without any fire.
She was in &#8220;a most lamentable condition,&#8221;
having her face all scorched with fire. This
deponent had no doubt as to the witch&#8217;s
guilt, &#8220;for that the said Amy hath been
long reputed to be a witch and a person
of very evil behaviour, whose kindred and
relations have been many of them accused
for witchcraft, and some of them have been
condemned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elizabeth Pacy was another bewitched
child. By direction of the judge, Amy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Duny was made to touch her, whereupon the
child clawed the Old Beldam till the blood
came&mdash;a portentous fact, for everybody knew
that the bewitched would naturally scratch
the tormentor&#8217;s face and thus obtain relief.
The father of the child, Samuel Pacy (whose
soberness and moderation are specially commended
by the reporter), now told how Amy
Duny thrice came to buy herrings, and, being
as often refused, &#8220;went away grumbling, but
what she said was not perfectly understood.&#8221;
Immediately his child Deborah fell sick,
whereupon Amy was set in the stocks. Here
she confessed that, when any of her offspring
were so afflicted, &#8220;she had been fain to open
her child&#8217;s mouth with a tap to give it
vitals,&#8221; which simple device the sapient Pacy
practised upon his brats with some effect, but
still continuing ill they vomited &#8220;crooked
pins and one time a twopenny nail with a
very broad head, which pins, amounting to
forty or more, together with the twopenny
nail, were produced in court,&#8221; so what room
was there for doubt? The children, continually
accusing Amy Duny and Rose Cullender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
as cause of their sickness, were packed off by
their distracted father to his sister at Yarmouth,
who now took up the wondrous
tale. When the younger child was taking
the air out of doors, &#8220;presently a little thing
like a bee flew upon her face, and would have
gone into her mouth.&#8221; She rushed indoors,
and incontinent vomited up a twopenny nail
with a broad head, whose presence she accounted
for thus: &#8220;the bee brought this nail
and forced it into her mouth&#8221;; from all which
the guilt of the witches was ever more evident.</p>

<p>Even that age had its sceptics. Some people
in court, chief among them Mr. Serjeant
Keeling, whose position and learning made
it impossible to disregard their opinion,
&#8220;seemed much unsatisfied.&#8221; The learned
serjeant pointed out that even if the children
were bewitched, there was no real evidence
to connect the prisoners with the fact.
Then Dr. Browne, of Norwich, &#8220;a person of
great knowledge&#8221; (no other, alas! than the
Sir Thomas Browne of the <i>Religio Medici</i>),
made a very learned if confusing dissertation
on Witchcraft in general, with some curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
details as to a late &#8220;great discovery of
witches&#8221; in Denmark; which no whit advanced
the matter. Then there was another
experiment. Amy Duny was brought to one
of the children whose eyes were blinded.
The child was presently touched by another
person, &#8220;which produced the same effect as
the touch of the witch did in the court.&#8221;
The sceptical Keeling and his set now roundly
declared the whole business a sham, which
&#8220;put the court and all persons into a stand.
But at length Mr. Pacy did declare that
possibly the maid might be deceived by a
suspicion that the witch touched her when
she did not.&#8221; This was the very point the
sceptics were making, and was anything but
an argument in reply, though it seems to
have been accepted as such. And how to
suppose, it was urged, that innocent children
would tell such terrible lies? It was the
golden age of the rod; never was there fitter
occasion for its use. Once fancies a few
strokes had produced remarkable confessions
from the innocents! However, the court
went on hearing evidence. The judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
summed up with much seeming impartiality,
much wooden wisdom, and the usual judicial
platitudes, all which after more than two
centuries you read with considerable irritation.
The jury upon half an hour&#8217;s deliberation
returned a verdict of guilty. Next
morning the children were brought to the
judge, &#8220;and Mr. Pacy did affirm that within
less than half an hour after the witches were
convicted they were all of them restored.&#8221;
After this, what place was left for doubt?
&#8220;In conclusion the judge and all the court
were fully satisfied with the verdict, and
thereupon gave judgment against the witches
that they should be hanged.&#8221; Three days
afterwards the poor unfortunates went to
their death. &#8220;They were much urged to
confess, but would not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, you have this much less tragic
business. In the first year of Queen Anne&#8217;s
reign (1702), Richard Hathaway was tried
at the Surrey Assizes before Lord Chief
Justice Holt for falsely accusing Sarah
Morduck of bewitching him. The offence
being a misdemeanour, the prisoner had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
counsel, an advantage not then fully given
to those charged with felony. The trial
reads like one in our own day. The case
for the Crown had been carefully put together.
Possibly the authorities were striking
at accusations of and prosecutions for
Witchcraft. Sarah Morduck had been tried
and acquitted at Guildford Assizes for bewitching
Hathaway, whereupon this
prosecution had been ordered. Dr. Martin,
parish minister in Southwark, an able and
enlightened divine, had saved Sarah from
the mob, and so was led on to probe the
matter. He found Hathaway apparently
blind and dumb, but giving his assent by a
sign to the suggestion that he should scratch
Morduck, and so (according to the superstition
already noted) obtain relief. Dr.
Martin brought Sarah and a woman of the
same height called Johnson to the room
where the impostor lay, seemingly, at death&#8217;s
door. Morduck announced her willingness
to be scratched, and then Johnson&#8217;s hand was
put into his. Hathaway was suspicious, and
felt the arm very carefully, whereat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
parson &#8220;spoke to him somewhat eagerly:
If you will not scratch I will begone.&#8221;
Whereupon he clawed so lustily that Johnson
near fainted. She was forthwith hustled
out of the room and Morduck pushed
forward; but the rogue, fearing a trap, lay
quiet till Dr. Martin encouraged him by
simulated admiration. Then he opened
wide his eyes, &#8220;caught hold of the apron
of Sarah Morduck, and looked her in the
face,&#8221; thus implying that his supposed
scratching of her had restored his eyesight.
Being informed of his blunder he &#8220;seemed
much cast down,&#8221; but his native impudence
soon asserting itself, he gave himself out for
worse than ever, whilst Sarah Morduck,
anxious to be clear at any cost, declared that
not she but Johnson was the witch. The
popular voice roundly abused Dr. Martin for
a stubborn sceptic. Charges of bribery against
him, as well as against the judge and jury who
had acquitted Morduck, were freely bandied
about. Dr. Martin had got Bateman a friend
of his to see Hathaway, one of whose symptoms
was the vomiting of pins. His evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was that the rogue scattered the pins about
the room by sleight of hand; Bateman had
taken several parcels of them, almost by
force, out of his pocket. Kensy, a surgeon,
further told how Hathaway, being committed
to his care, at first would neither eat nor
drink. Kensy being afraid that he would
starve himself to death sooner than have
his cheat discovered, arranged a pretended
quarrel with his maid Baker, who supplied
the patient with food as if against his orders.
Indeed, she plied him so well with meat and
drink that, so she told the court, &#8220;he was
very merry and danced about, and took the
tongs and played upon them, but after that
he was mightily sick and vomited sadly&#8221;&mdash;but
there were no pins and needles! She
further told how four gentlemen, privily
stored away in the buttery and coal-hole,
witnessed Hathaway&#8217;s gastronomic feats.
Serjeant Jenner for the defence called
several witnesses, who testified to the prisoner&#8217;s
abstinence from food for quite
miraculous periods. The force of this
evidence was much shaken by the pertinent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
cross-examination of the judge, who asked
the jury in his summing up, &#8220;Whether you
have any evidence to induce you to believe it
to be in the power of all the witches in the
world, or all the Devils in Hell, to fast
beyond the usual time that nature will allow:
they cannot invert the order of nature.&#8221;
The jury, &#8220;without going from the bar,
brought him in Guilty.&#8221; He was sentenced
to a fine, a sound flogging, the pillory, and
imprisonment with hard labour. The last
conviction for Witchcraft in England was
that of Jane Wenham, at Hertford, in 1712.
She was respited by the judge and afterwards
pardoned. The case is not here
reported.</p>

<p>These trials throw a curious light on the
ideas of the time; unfortunately they exhibit
human nature in some of its worst aspects.
The victims were women, old, poor, helpless,
and the persecution to which they were subjected
was due partly to superstition, partly
to that delight in cruelty so strong in the
natural man. The &#8220;confessions&#8221; of the accused
are easily accounted for. The popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
beliefs so impressed their imaginations that
they believed in their own malevolent power,
also the terror they inspired lacked not
charm, it procured them consideration, some
money, even some protection. Not seldom
their &#8220;confessions&#8221; were merely terrified
assents to statements made about them by
witch-finders, clergymen, and justices. And
the judges? Sometimes, alas! they callously
administered a law in which they
had no belief. Is there not still something
inexplicable? Well, such things as mesmerism,
thought-reading, and so forth exhibit
remarkable phenomena. A former age
ascribed all to Satan: we believe them
natural though we cannot as yet solve all
their riddles. I must add that the ancient
popular horror of witches is partly explained
by the hideous and grotesque details given
at the trials, but those obscenities I dare not
reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a new series of <i>State Trials</i> continuing
the old, and edited with a skill and
completeness altogether lacking in its predecessor;
yet its formal correctness gives
an impression of dulness. You think with
regret of Howell&#8217;s thirty-three huge volumes,
that vast magazine of curiosities and horrors,
of all that is best and worst in English
history. How exciting life was long ago, to
be sure, and how persistently it grows duller!
What a price we pay for the smug comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of our time! People shuddered of yore; did
they yawn quite so often? Howell and the
folk he edits knew how to tell a story.
Judges, too, were not wont to exclude interesting
detail for that it wasn&#8217;t evidence, and
the compilers did not end with a man&#8217;s condemnation.
They had too keen a sense of
what was relished of the general: the last
confession and dying speech, the exit on the
scaffold or from the cart, are told with infinite
gusto. What a terrible test earth&#8217;s great
unfortunates underwent! Sir Thomas More&#8217;s
delicate fencing with his judges, the exquisite
courtesy wherewith he bade them farewell,
make but half the record; you must hear
the strange gaiety which flashed in the condemned
cell and by the block ere you learn
the man&#8217;s true nature. And to know Raleigh
you must see him at Winchester under the
brutal insults of Coke; &#8220;Thou art a monster,
thou hast an English face but a Spanish
heart;&#8221; again, &#8220;I thou thee, thou traitor!&#8221;
and at Palace Yard, Westminster, on that
dreary October morning urging the sheriff to
hurry, since he would not be thought fear-shaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
when it was but the ague; for these
are all-important episodes in the life of that
richly dressed, stately, and gallant figure your
fancy is wont to picture in his Elizabethan
warship sweeping the Spanish Main. Time
would fail to tell of Strafford and Charles
and Laud and a hundred others, for the
collection begins with Thomas à Becket in
1163 and comes down to Thistlewood in 1820.
Once familiar with those close packed, badly
printed pages, you find therein a deeper, a
more subtle charm than cunningest romance
can furnish forth. The account of Mary
Stuart&#8217;s ending has a finer hold than Froude&#8217;s
magnificent and highly decorated picture&mdash;Study
at first hand &#8220;Bloody Jeffreys,&#8221; his
slogging of Titus Oates, with that unabashed
rascal&#8217;s replies during his trial for perjury; or
again, my Lord&#8217;s brilliant though brutal
cross-examination of Dunn in the &#8220;Lady&#8221;
Alice Lisle case, during the famous or infamous
Western Circuit, and you will find
Macaulay&#8217;s wealth of vituperative rhetoric,
in comparison, tiresome and pointless verbiage.
Also you will prefer to construct your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Braxfield from trials like those of Thomas
Muir in 1793, and of Alexander Scott and
Maurice Margarot in 1794, rather than
accept the counterfeit presentment which
Stevenson&#8217;s master-hand has limned in <i>Weir
of Hermiston</i>.</p>

<p>But the interests are varied. How full of
grotesque and curious horrors are the prosecutions
for witchcraft! There is that one,
for instance, in March 1665 at Bury St.
Edmunds before Sir Matthew Hale, with
stories of bewitched children, and plague-stricken
women, and satanic necromancy.
Again, there is the diverting exposure of
Richard Hathaway in 1702, and how the
rogue pretended to vomit pins and abstain
from meat or drink for quite miraculous
periods. But most of those things I deal
with elsewhere in this volume. The trials
of obscurer criminals have their own charm.
Where else do you find such Dutch pictures
of long-vanished interiors or exteriors?
You touch the <i>vie intime</i> of a past age; you
see how kitchen and hall lived and talked;
what master and man, mistress and maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
thought and felt; how they were dressed,
what they ate, of what they gossiped.
Again, how oft your page recalls the
strange, mad, picturesque ways of old English
law! <i>Benefit of clergy</i> meets you at
every turn, the <i>Peine Fort et Dure</i> is
explained with horrible minuteness, the lore
of <i>Ship Money</i> as well as of <i>Impressment
of Seamen</i> is all there. Also is an occasional
touch of farce. But what phase of
man&#8217;s life goes unrecorded in those musty
old tomes?</p>

<p>Howell&#8217;s collection only comes down to
1820. Reform has since then purged our law,
and the whole set is packed off to the Lumber
Room. In a year&#8217;s current reports you may
find the volumes quoted once or twice, but
that is &#8220;but a bravery,&#8221; as Lord Bacon
would say, for their law is &#8220;a creed outworn.&#8221;
Yet the human interest of a story remains,
however antiquated the setting, incapable of
hurt from Act of Parliament. So, partly
for themselves, partly as samples of the bulk,
I here present in altered form two of these
tragedies, a Pair of Parricides: one Scots of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the seventeenth, the other English of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The first is the case of Philip Standsfield,
tried at Edinburgh, in 1688, for the murder
of his father, Sir James Standsfield, of New
Mills, in East Lothian. To-day New Mills
is called Amisfield; it lies on the south bank
of the Tyne, a mile east of Haddington.
There is a fine mansion-house about a century
old in the midst of a well wooded
park, and all round are the superbly tilled
Lothian fields, as <i>dulcia arva</i> as ever the
Mantuan sang. Amisfield got its present
name thus: Colonel Charteris, infamed (in
the phrase of Arbuthnot&#8217;s famous epitaph)
for the &#8220;undeviating pravity of his manners&#8221;
(hence lashed by Pope in many a stinging
line), purchased it early in the last century
and re-named it from the seat of his
family in Nithsdale. Through him it passed
by descent to the house of Wemyss, still its
owners. Amongst its trees and its waters the
place lies away from the beaten track and is
now as charmingly peaceful a spot as you
shall anywhere discover. Name gone and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
aspect changed, local tradition has but a
vague memory of the two-centuries-old
tragedy whereof it was the centre.</p>

<p>Sir James Standsfield, an Englishman by
birth, had married a Scots lady and spent
most of his life in Scotland. After the
Restoration he had established a successful
cloth factory at the place called New Mills,
and there lived, a prosperous gentleman.
But he had much domestic trouble chiefly
from the conduct of his eldest son Philip,
who, though well brought up, led a wild life.
Whilst &#8220;this profligate youth&#8221; (so Wodrow,
who tells the story, dubs him) was a student
at the University of St. Andrews, curiosity
or mischief led him to attend a conventicle
where godly Mr. John Welch was holding
forth. Using a chance loaf as a missile, he
smote the astonished divine, who, failing to
discover the culprit, was moved to prophecy.
&#8220;There would be,&#8221; he thundered, &#8220;more present
at the death of him who did it, than
were hearing him that day; and the multitude
was not small.&#8221; Graver matters than this
freak stained the lad&#8217;s later career. Serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
abroad in the Scots regiment, he had been
condemned to death at Treves, but had
escaped by flight. Certain notorious villainies
had also made him familiar with the interior
of the Marshalsea and the prisons of Brussels,
Antwerp, and Orleans. Sir James at last
was moved to disinherit him in favour of his
second son John. Partly cause and partly
effect of this, Philip was given to cursing his
father in most extravagant terms (of itself a
capital offence according to old Scots law);
he affirmed his parent &#8220;girned upon him
like a sheep&#8217;s head in a tongs;&#8221; on several
occasions he had even attempted that parent&#8217;s
life: all which is set forth at great length in
the &#8220;ditty&#8221; or indictment upon which he
was tried. No doubt Sir James went in
considerable fear of his unnatural son. A
certain Mr. Roderick Mackenzie, advocate,
testifies that eight days before the end he
met the old gentleman in the Parliament
Close, Edinburgh, whereupon &#8220;the defunct
invited him to take his morning draught.&#8221;
As they partook Sir James bemoaned his
domestic troubles. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mackenzie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
but why had he disherished his son?
And the defunct answered: &#8220;Ye do not
know my son, for he is the greatest debauch
in the earth. And that which troubles
me most is that he twice attempted my own
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the last Saturday of November
1687, the elder Standsfield travelled from
Edinburgh to New Mills in company with
Mr. John Bell, minister of the Gospel, who
was to officiate the next day in Morham
Church (Morham is a secluded parish on the
lower slope of the Lammermoors, some
three miles south-west of New Mills; the
church plays an important part in what
follows). Arrived at New Mills the pair
supped together, thereafter the host accompanied
his guest to his chamber, where he
sat talking &#8220;pertinently and to good
purpose&#8221; till about ten o&#8217;clock. Left alone,
our divine gat him to bed, but had scarce
fallen asleep when he awoke in terror, for a
terrible cry rang through the silence of the
winter night. A confused murmur of voices
and a noise of folk moving about succeeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Mr. Bell incontinently set all down to &#8220;evil
wicked spirits,&#8221; so having seen to the bolts
of his chamber door, and having fortified
his timid soul with prayers, he huddled in
bed again; but the voices and noises continuing
outside the house he crept to the
window, where peering out he perceived
nought in the darkness. The noises died
away across the garden towards the river,
and Bell lay quaking till the morning. An
hour after day Philip came to his chamber
to ask if his father had been there, for he
had been seeking him upon the banks of the
water. &#8220;Why on the banks of that water?&#8221;
queried Bell in natural amazement. Without
answer Philip hurriedly left the room.
Later that same Sunday morning a certain
John Topping coming from Monkrig to New
Mills, along the bank of the Tyne, saw a
man&#8217;s body floating on the water. Philip,
drawn to the spot by some terrible fascination,
was looking on (you picture his face).
&#8220;Whose body was it?&#8221; asked the horror-struck
Topping, but Philip replied not.
Well <i>he</i> knew it was his father&#8217;s corpse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
It was noted that, though a hard frosty morning,
the bank was &#8220;all beaten to mash with
feet and the ground very open and mellow.&#8221;
The dead man being presently dragged forth
and carried home was refused entry by
Philip into the house so late his own, &#8220;for
he had not died like a man but like a beast,&#8221;&mdash;the
suggestion being that his father had
drowned himself,&mdash;and so the poor remains
must rest in the woollen mill, and then in a
cellar &#8220;where there was very little light.&#8221;
The gossips retailed unseemly fragments of
scandal, as &#8220;within an hour after his father&#8217;s
body was brought from the water, he got
the buckles from his father&#8217;s shoes and put
them in his;&#8221; and again, there is note of a
hideous and sordid quarrel between Lady
Standsfield and Janet Johnstoun, &#8220;who was
his own concubine,&#8221; so the prosecution
averred, &#8220;about some remains of the Holland
of the woonding-sheet,&#8221; with some incriminating
words of Philip that accompanied.</p>

<p>I now take up the story as given by
Umphrey Spurway, described as an Englishman
and clothier at New Mills. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
suspicions caused him to write to Edinburgh
that the Lord Advocate might be warned.
Philip lost no time in trying to prevent an
inquiry. At three or four of the clock on
Monday morning Spurway, coming out of
his house, saw &#8220;great lights at Sir James&#8217;
Gate;&#8221; grouped round were men and horses.
He was told they were taking away the
body to be buried at Morham, whereat
honest Umphrey, much disturbed at this
suspicious haste, sighed for the &#8220;crowner&#8217;s
quest law&#8221; of his fatherland. But on the
next Tuesday night after he had gone to
bed a party of five men, two of them surgeons,
came post haste to his house from
Edinburgh, and showing him an order
&#8220;from my Lord Advocat for the taking
up again the body of Sir James Standsfield,&#8221;
bid him rise and come. Philip also must go
with the party to Morham. Here the grave
was opened, the body taken out and carried
into the church, where the surgeons made
their examination, which clearly pointed to
death by strangulation not by drowning
(possibly it struck Spurway as an odd use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for a church; it had not seemed so to a
presbyterian Scot of the period). The dead
being re-dressed in his grave clothes must
now be set back in his coffin. A terrible
thing happened. According to Scots custom
the nearest relative must lift the body,
and so Philip took the head, when lo! the
corpse gushed forth blood on his hands!
He dropped the head&mdash;the &#8220;considerable
noise&#8221; it made in falling is noted by one
of the surgeons&mdash;frantically essayed to wipe
off the blood on his clothes, and with
frenzied cries of &#8220;Lord have mercy upon
me, Lord have mercy upon us!&#8221; fell half
swooning across a seat. Strong cordials
were administered, and in time he regained
his sullen composure.</p>

<p>A strange scene to ponder over, but how
terrible to witness! Think of it! The
lonely church on the Lammermoors, the
dead vast and middle of the dreary night
(November 30, 1687), the murdered man,
and the Parricide&#8217;s confession (it is so set
forth in the &#8220;ditty&#8221;) wrung from him (as
all believed) by the direct interposition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Providence. What fiction ever equalled
this gruesome horror? Even his mother,
who had sided with him against the father,
scarce professed to believe his innocence.
&#8220;What if they should put her bairn in
prison?&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;Her bairn&#8221; was
soon hard and fast in the gloomy old
Tolbooth of Edinburgh, to which, as the
<i>Heart of Midlothian</i>, Scott&#8217;s novel was in
future days to give a world-wide fame.</p>

<p>The trial came on February 6 ensuing.
In Scotland there is no inquest or public
magisterial examination to discount the
interest of the story, and the crowd that
listened in the Parliament House to the
evidence already detailed had their bellyful
of surprises and horrors. The Crown had
still in reserve this testimony, sensational
and deadly. The prosecution proposed to
call James Thomson, a boy of thirteen, and
Anna Mark, a girl of ten. Their tender
years were objected. My Lords, declining to
receive them as witnesses, oddly enough
consented at the request of the jury to take
their declaration. The boy told how Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
came to his father&#8217;s house on the night of
the murder. The lad was hurried off to
bed, but listened whilst the panel, Janet
Johnstoun, already mentioned, and his
father and mother softly whispered together
for a long time, until Philip&#8217;s rage got the
better of his discretion, and he loudly
cursed his father and threatened his life.
Next Philip and Janet left the house, and
in the dead of night his father and mother
followed. After two hours they crept back
again; and the boy, supposed to be sleeping,
heard them whisper to each other the
story of the murder, how Philip guarded
the chamber door &#8220;with a drawn sword and
a bendit pistol,&#8221; how it was strange a man
should die so soon, how they earned the
body to the water and threw it in, and how
his mother ever since was afraid to stay
alone in the house after nightfall. The
evidence of Anna Mark was as to certain
criminating words used by her mother Janet
Johnstoun.</p>

<p>Up to this time the panel had been defended
by four eminent advocates mercifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
appointed thereto by the Privy Council;
there had been the usual Allegations, Replyes,
and Duplies, with frequent citations
from Mattheus, Carpzovius, Muscard, and
the other fossils, as to the matters contained
in the &#8220;ditty&#8221; (indictment), and they had
strenuously fought for him till now, but after
the statement of the children they retired.
Then Sir George Mackenzie rose to reply for
the Crown. Famous in his own day, his name
is not yet forgotten. He was &#8220;the bluidy
advocate Mackenzie&#8221; of Covenanting legend
and tradition, one of the figures in Wandering
Willie&#8217;s tale in <i>Redgauntlet</i> (&#8220;who for
his worldly wit and wisdom had been to the
rest as a god&#8221;). He had been Lord Advocate
already, and was presently to be Lord
Advocate again. Nominally but second
counsel he seems to have conducted the
whole prosecution. He had a strong case,
and he made the most of it. Passionate
invective and prejudicial matter were mixed
with legal argument. Cultured politician
and jurist as he was, he dwelt with terrible
emphasis on the scene in Morham kirk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
&#8220;God Almighty Himself was pleased to bear
a share in the testimonies which we produce.&#8221;
Nor was the children&#8217;s testimony forgotten.
&#8220;I need not fortifie so pregnant a probation.&#8221;
No! yet he omitted not to protest
for &#8220;an Assize of Error against the inquest
in the case they should assoilzie the pannal&#8221;&mdash;a
plain intimation to jury that if they
found Philip Standsfield &#8220;not guilty&#8221; they
were liable to be prosecuted for an unjust
verdict. But how to doubt after such evidence?
The jury straightway declared the
panel guilty, and my lords pronounced a
sentence of picturesque barbarity. Standsfield
was to be hanged at the Mercat Cross
of Edinburgh, his tongue cut out and burned
upon the scaffold, his right hand fixed
above the east port of Haddington, and his
dead body hung in chains upon the Gallow
Lee betwixt Leith and Edinburgh, his name
disgraced for ever, and all his property forfeited
to the Crown. According to the old
Scots custom the sentence was given &#8220;by
the mouth of John Leslie, dempster of
court&#8221;&mdash;an office held along with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
hangman. &#8220;Which is pronounced for doom&#8221;
was the formula wherewith he concluded.</p>

<p>On February 15 Standsfield though led
to the scaffold was reprieved for eight
days &#8220;at the priest&#8217;s desire, who had been
tampering to turn Papist&#8221; (one remembers
these were the last days of James II., or as
they called him in Scotland, James VII.&#8217;s
reign). Nothing came of the delay, and
when finally brought out on the 24th &#8220;he
called for Presbyterian ministers.&#8221; Through
some slipping of the rope, the execution
was bungled; finally the hangman strangled
his patient. The &#8220;near resemblance of his
father&#8217;s death&#8221; is noted by an eye-witness.
&#8220;Yet Edmund was beloved.&#8221; Leave was
asked to bury the remains. One fancies
this was on the part of Lady Standsfield,
regarding whose complicity and doting
fondness, strange stories were current. The
prayer was refused, but the body was
found lying in a ditch a few days after, and
again the gossips (with a truly impious
desire to &#8220;force the hand&#8221; of Providence)
saw a likeness to the father&#8217;s end. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
more the body was taken down and presently
vanished.</p>

<p>Lord Fountainhall, a contempory of Standsfield,
and Sir Walter Scott, both Scots
lawyers of high official position, thought
the evidence of Standsfield&#8217;s guilt not altogether
conclusive, and believed something
might be urged for the alternative theory of
suicide. Whilst venturing to differ, I note
the opinion of such eminent authorities with
all respect.</p>

<p>Standsfield maintained his innocence to
the last. Three servants of his father&#8217;s&mdash;two
men and a woman&mdash;were seized and tortured
with the thumbikins. They confessed nothing.
Now, torture was frequently used
in old Scots criminal procedure, but if you
did not confess you were almost held to
have proved your innocence.</p>

<p>I cannot discover the after fate of these
servants, and probably they were banished&mdash;a
favourite method with the Scots authorities
for getting rid of objectionable
characters whose guilt was not sufficiently
proved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>The second case, not so romantic albeit a
love-story is woven through its tangled
threads, is that of Mary Blandy, spinster,
tried at Oxford in 1752, before two of the
Barons of the Exchequer, for the murder of
her father, Francis Blandy, attorney, and
town clerk of Henley-on-Thames. Prosecuting
counsel described her as &#8220;genteel, agreeable,
sprightly, sensible.&#8221; She was an only
child. Her sire being well off she seemed
an eligible match, and yet wooers tarried.
Some years before the murder, the villain of
the piece, William Henry Cranstoun, a
younger son of the Scots Lord Cranstoun and
an officer recruiting at Henley for the army,
comes on the scene. Contemporary gossip
paints him the blackest colour. &#8220;His shape
no ways genteel, his legs clumsy, he has
nothing in the least elegant in his manner.&#8221;
He was remarkable for his dulness; he was
dissipated and poverty-stricken. More fatal
than all he had a wife and child in Scotland,
though he brazenly declared the marriage
invalid spite the judgment of the Scots
courts in its favour. Our respectable attorney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
upon discovering these facts, gave the Captain,
as he was called, the cold shoulder. The
prospect of a match with a Lord&#8217;s son was too
much for Miss Blandy, now over thirty, and
she was ready to believe any ridiculous yarn
he spun about his northern entanglements.
Fired by an exaggerated idea of old Blandy&#8217;s
riches, he planned his death, and found in
the daughter an agent and, as the prosecution
averred, an accomplice.</p>

<p>The way was prepared by a cunning use of
popular superstitions. Mysterious sounds of
music were heard about; at least Cranstoun
said so; indeed, it was afterwards alleged he
&#8220;hired a band to play under the windows.&#8221;
If any one asked &#8220;What then?&#8221; he whispered
&#8220;that a wise woman, one Mrs. Morgan,
in Scotland,&#8221; had assured him that such was
a sign of death to the head of the house
within twelve months. The Captain further
alleged that he held the gift of second sight
and had seen the worthy attorney&#8217;s ghost;
all which, being carefully reported to the
servants by Miss Blandy raised a pleasing
horror in the kitchen. Cranstoun, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
necessity or prudence, left Henley before the
diabolical work began in earnest, but he supplied
Mary with arsenic in powder, which
she administered to her father for many
months. The doses were so immoderate that
the unfortunate man&#8217;s teeth dropped whole
from their sockets, whereat the undutiful
daughter &#8220;damn&#8217;d him for a toothless old
rogue and wished him to hell.&#8221; Cranstoun,
under the guise of a present of Scotch pebbles,
sent her some more arsenic, nominally to rub
them with. In the accompanying letter,
July 18, 1751, he glowingly touched on the
beauties of Scotland as an inducement to
her, it was supposed, to make haste. Rather
zealous than discreet, she near poisoned Anne
Emmett, the charwoman, by misadventure,
but brought her round again with great
quantities of sack whey and thin mutton
broth, sovereign remedies against arsenic.</p>

<p>Her father gradually became desperately
ill. Susannah Gunnell, maidservant perceiving
a white powder at the bottom of a
dish she was cleaning had it preserved. It
proved to be arsenic, and was produced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the trial. Susannah actually told Mr.
Blandy he was being poisoned; but he only
remarked, &#8220;Poor lovesick girl! what will not
a woman do for the man she loves?&#8221; Both
master and maid fixed the chief, perhaps the
whole, guilt on Cranstoun, the father confining
himself to dropping some strong hints
to his daughter, which made her throw
Cranstoun&#8217;s letters and the remainder of the
poison on the fire, wherefrom the drug was
in secret rescued and preserved by the servants.</p>

<p>Mr. Blandy was now hopelessly ill, and
though experienced doctors were at length
called in, he expired on Wednesday, August
14, 1751. The sordid tragedy gets its most
pathetic and highest touch from the attempts
made by the dying man to shield his daughter
and to hinder her from incriminating admissions
which under excitement and (one
hopes) remorse she began to make. And in
his last hours he spoke to her words of
pardon and solace. That night and again
on Thursday morning the daughter made
some distracted efforts to escape. &#8220;I ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
out of the house and over the bridge, and
had nothing on but a half-sack and petticoat
without a hoop&mdash;my petticoats hanging
about me.&#8221; But now all Henley was
crowded round the dwelling to watch the
development of events. The mob pressed after
the distracted girl, who took refuge at the
sign of the Angel, a small inn just across the
bridge. &#8220;They were going to open her father,&#8221;
she said, and &#8220;she could not bear the house.&#8221;
She was taken home and presently committed
to Oxford Gaol to await her trial. Here she
was visited by the high sheriff, who &#8220;told
me by order of the higher powers he must
put an iron on me. I submitted as I always do
to the higher powers&#8221; (she had little choice).
Spite her terrible position and these indignities
she behaved with calmness and courage.</p>

<p>The trial, which lasted twelve hours, took
place on February 29, 1752, in the Divinity
School of the University. The prisoner
was &#8220;sedate and composed without levity
or dejection.&#8221; Accused of felony, she had
properly counsel only for points of law,
but at her request they were allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
examine and cross-examine the witnesses.
Herself spoke a defence possibly prepared
by her advisers, for though the style be artless,
the reasoning is exceeding ingenious.
She admitted she was passionate and thus
accounted for some hasty expressions; the
malevolence of servants had exaggerated
these. Betty Binfield, one of the maids, was
credibly reported to have said of her, &#8220;she
should be glad to see the black bitch go up
the ladder to be hanged.&#8221; But the powder?
Impossible to deny she had administered
that. &#8220;I gave it to procure his love.&#8221;
Cranstoun, she affirmed, had sent it from
Scotland, assuring her that it would so work,
and Scotland, one notes, seemed to everybody
&#8220;the shores of old romance,&#8221; the home of
magic incantations and mysterious charms.
It was powerfully objected that Francis
Blandy had never failed in love to his
daughter, but she replied that the drug was
given to reconcile her father to Cranstoun.
She granted he meant to kill the old man in
hopes to get his money, and she was the
agent, but (she asserted) the innocent agent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of his wicked purpose. This theory though
the best available was beset with difficulties.
She had made many incriminating statements,
there was the long time over which
the doses had been spread, there was her
knowledge of its effects on Anne Emmett
the charwoman, there was the destruction
of Cranstoun&#8217;s letters, the production
of which would have conclusively shown
the exact measure in which guilty knowledge
was shared. Finally, there was the
attempt to destroy the powder. Bathurst,
leading counsel for the Crown, delivered two
highly rhetorical speeches, &#8220;drawing floods
of tears from the most learned audience that
perhaps ever attended an English Provincial
Tribunal.&#8221; The jury after some five
minutes&#8217; consultation in the box returned a
verdict of &#8220;guilty,&#8221; which the prisoner
received with perfect composure. All she
asked was a little time &#8220;till I can settle my
affairs and make my peace with God,&#8221; and
this was readily granted. She was left in
prison five weeks.</p>

<p>The case continued to excite enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
interest, increased by an account which she
issued from prison of her father&#8217;s death and
her relations with Cranstoun. She was constant
in her professions of innocence, &#8220;nor
did anything during the whole course of her
confinement so extremely shock her as the
charge of infidelity which some uncharitable
persons a little before her death brought
against her.&#8221; Some were convinced and
denied her guilt, &#8220;as if,&#8221; said Horace Walpole,
&#8220;a woman who would not stick at
parricide would scruple a lie.&#8221; Others said
she had hopes of pardon &#8220;from the Honour
she had formerly had of dancing for several
nights with the late P&mdash;&mdash;e of W&mdash;&mdash;s, and
being personally known to the most sweet-tempered
P&mdash;ess in the world.&#8221; The press
swarmed with pamphlets. The Cranstoun
correspondence, alleged not destroyed, was
published&mdash;a very palpable Grub Street
forgery! and a tragedy, <i>The Fair Parricide</i>,
dismal in every sense, was inflicted on the
world. The last scene of all was on April 6,
1752. &#8220;Miss Blandy suffered in a black
bombazine short sack and petticoat, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
clean white handkerchief drawn over her
face. Her hands were tied together with a
strong black riband, and her feet at her own
request almost touched the ground&#8221; (&#8220;Gentlemen,
don&#8217;t hang me high for the sake of
decency,&#8221; an illustration of British prudery
which has escaped the notice of French
critics). She mounted the ladder with some
hesitation. &#8220;I am afraid I shall fall.&#8221; For
the last time she declared her innocence, and
soon all was over. &#8220;The number of people
attending her execution was computed at
about 5000, many of whom, and particularly
several gentlemen of the university, were
observed to shed tears&#8221; (tender-hearted
&#8220;gentlemen of the university&#8221;!) &#8220;In
about half an hour the body was cut down
and carried through the crowd upon the
shoulders of a man with her legs exposed
very indecently.&#8221; Late the same night she
was laid beside her father and mother in
Henley Church.</p>

<p>Cranstoun fled from justice and was outlawed.
In December that same year he died
in Flanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom. The marrying in the Fleet is the
beginning of eternal woe.&#8221; So scribbled
(1736) Walter Wyatt, a Fleet Parson, in
one of his note-books. He and his likes are
long vanished, and his successor the blacksmith
priest (in truth he was neither one
nor other) of Gretna is also gone; yet their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
story is no less entertaining than instructive,
and here I set it forth.</p>

<p>Some prefatory matter is necessary for
the right understanding of what follows.
Marriage, whatever else it may or may not
be, is a contract of two consenting minds;
but at an early age the church put forth the
doctrine that it was likewise a sacrament
which could be administered by the contracting
parties to each other. Pope Innocent
III., in 1215, first ordained&mdash;so some
authorities say&mdash;that marriages must be
celebrated in church; but it was not yet
decreed that other and simpler methods were
without effect. According to the canon law,
&#8220;espousals&#8221; were of two kinds: <i>sponsalia
per verba de præsenti</i>&mdash;which was an agreement
to marry forthwith; and <i>sponsalia per
verba de futuro</i>&mdash;which was a contract to
wed at a future time. Consummation gave
number two the effect of number one, and
civilly that effect was the same as of duly
celebrated nuptials; inasmuch as the church,
while urging the religious ceremony upon
the faithful as the sole proper method, admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the validity of the others&mdash;<i>quod non
fieri debit id factum valeat</i> (so the maxim
ran). The common law adopting this, held
that (1) marriage might be celebrated with
the full rites of the church; or (2) that the
parties might take each other for man and
wife; or (3), which obviously followed, that
a priest might perform the ceremony outside
the church, or without the full ceremonial&mdash;with
maimed rites, so to speak. Whatever
penalties were incurred by following other
than the first way the marriage itself held
good.</p>

<p>I must here note that in 1844, in the case
of <i>The Queen against Millis</i>, the House of
Lords <i>seemed</i> to decide that there could not
have been a valid marriage in England, even
before Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s Act, which in 1753
completely changed the law, in the absence
of an ordained ecclesiastic. The arguments
and the judgment fill the half of one of
Clark and Finnelly&#8217;s bulky volumes, and
never was matter more thoroughly threshed,
and winnowed, and garnered. The House
was equally divided; and the opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Irish Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench, which maintained
the necessity of the priest&#8217;s presence,
was affirmed. The real explanation, I think,
is that, though the old canon law and the
old common law were as I have stated, yet
English folk had got so much into the habit
of calling in the Parson that his presence
came to be regarded as essential. The
parties, even when they disobeyed the church
by leaving undone much they were ordered
to do, would still have &#8220;something religious&#8221;
about the ceremony. In 1563 the Council
of Trent declared such marriages invalid as
were not duly celebrated in church; but
Elizabeth&#8217;s reign was already five years gone,
both England and Scotland had broken
decisively with the old faith, and the Council&#8217;s
decrees had no force here.</p>

<p>In England both church and state kept
tinkering the Marriage Laws. In 1603 the
Convocation for the Province of Canterbury
declared that no minister shall solemnise
matrimony without banns or licence upon
pain of suspension for three years. Also, all
marriages were to be in the parish church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
between eight and twelve in the forenoon.
Nothing so far affected the validity of the
business; and &#8220;clandestine marriages,&#8221; as
they were called, became frequent. In 1695,
an Act of William III. fined the Parson who
assisted at such couplings one hundred
pounds for the first offence, and for the
second suspended him for three years. This
enactment was followed almost immediately
by another, which mulcted the clergyman
who celebrated or permitted any such
marriage in his church as well as the bridegroom
and the clerk. The main object of this
legislation was to prevent the loss of duties
payable upon regularly performed marriages;
but it strengthened ecclesiastical discipline.</p>

<p>Thus your correct wedding, then as now,
had its tedious preliminaries; but the fashion
of the time imposed some other burdens.
There was inordinate feasting with music
and gifts and altogether much expense and
delay. Poor folk could ill afford the business;
now and again the rich desired a private
ceremony; here and there young people
sighed for a runaway match. Also, outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
this trim and commonplace century the
nation&#8217;s life had not that smoothness which
seems to us such a matter of course. Passion
was stronger and worse disciplined; law,
though harsh, was slow and uncertain. How
tempting, then, the inducement to needy
persons to marry cheaply and without
ceremony! Now, London had a number of
places of worship called <i>Peculiars</i>, which, as
royal chapels, possessions of the Lord Mayor
and alderman, or what not, claimed, rightly
or wrongly, exemption from the visitation of
the ordinary. These were just the places for
irregular or clandestine marriages. Peculiars
or not, as many as ninety chapels favoured
such affairs. Chief among them were the
Savoy, the Minories, Mayfair Chapel, and
(above all) the Fleet, which&mdash;from a very
early date to half a century ago&mdash;was a
famous prison especially for debtors, standing
on what is now the east side of Farringdon
Street. It had a chapel where marriages
were properly solemnised by 1613, and (it
may be) earlier; but the records are somewhat
scanty. Now, a number of dissolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Parsons were &#8220;fleeted&#8221; (as the old phrase
ran) for one cause or another, and some
might live outside the walls but within the
<i>rules</i> or <i>liberties of the Fleet</i>, as the ground
about the prison was called. These obtained
the use of the chapel, where, for a reasonable
consideration, they were willing to couple
any brace forthwith. What terror had the
law for them? Men already in hold for
debt laughed at a fine, and suspension was a
process slow and like to be ineffectual at the
last. The church feebly tried to exercise
discipline. On June 4, 1702, the Bishop of
London held a visitation <i>in carcere vulgo
vocat&#8217; ye Fleet in civitate London</i>. He found
one Jeronimus Alley coupling clients at a
great rate. &#8217;Twas hinted that Jeronimus
was not a Parson at all, and proof of his
ordination was demanded; &#8220;but Mr. Alley
soon afterwards fled from <i>ye said prison</i> and
never exhibited his orders.&#8221; Another record
says that he obtained &#8220;some other preferment&#8221;
(probably he was playing the like game
elsewhere).</p>

<p>The legislature, in despair, as it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
seem, now struck at more responsible heads.
In 1712 a statute (10 Ann. c. 19) imposed the
penalty of a hundred pounds on keepers of
gaols permitting marriage without banns or
licence within their walls. This closed the
Fleet Chapel to such nuptials, but private
houses did just as well. Broken-down
Parsons, bond or free, were soon plentiful as
blackberries; and taverns stood at every
corner; so at the &#8220;Two Fighting Men and
Walnut Tree,&#8221; at &#8220;The Green Canister,&#8221; at
&#8220;The Bull and Garter,&#8221; at &#8220;The Noah&#8217;s
Ark,&#8221; at &#8220;The Horseshoe and Magpie,&#8221; at
&#8220;Jack&#8217;s Last Shift,&#8221; at &#8220;The Shepherd and
Goat,&#8221; at &#8220;The Leg&#8221; (to name no more), a
room was fitted up in a sort of caricature of
a chapel; and here during the ceremony a
clock with doubly brazen hands stood ever
at one of the canonical hours though without
it might be midnight or three in the
morning. A Parson, hired at twenty shillings
a week, &#8220;hit or miss,&#8221; as &#8217;twas curiously
put, attended. The business was mostly
done on Sundays, Thursdays, and Fridays;
but ready, ay ready, was the word. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
landlord or a servingman played clerk, and
what more was wanted?</p>

<p>There were many orders of Fleet Parsons,
some not parsons at all. At the top of the
tree was the &#8220;famous Dr. John Gaynam,&#8221;
known as the &#8220;Bishop of Hell:&#8221; he made
a large income and in his time coupled
legions; and at the bottom were a parcel
of fellows who would marry any couple
anywhere for anything. The Fleet Parson
of standing kept a pocket-book in which
he roughly jotted down the particulars
of each marriage, transcribing the more
essential details to a larger register at
home. Certificates, at a varying charge,
were made out from these, and the books
being thus a source of profit were preserved
with a certain care. To falsify such documents
was child&#8217;s play. Little accidents (as
a birth in the midst of the ceremony) were
dissembled by inserting the notice of the
marriage in some odd corner of a more or
less ancient record. This antedating of
registers was so common as almost to deprive
them of any value as evidence. Worse still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
certificates were now and again issued,
though there had been no marriage. Sometimes
the taverners kept registers of their
own, but how to establish a fixed rule?</p>

<p>Not all the &#8220;marriage houses,&#8221; as they
were called, were taverns. They were often
distinguished by some touching device: as a
pair of clasping hands with the legend
&#8220;Marriages Performed Within.&#8221; A feature
of the system was the <i>plyer</i> or <i>barker</i>, who,
dressed in ragged and rusty black, touted for
Parson or publican, or it might be for self,
vaunting himself the while clerk and register
to the Fleet. &#8220;These ministers of wickedness&#8221;
(thus, in 1735, a correspondent of
<i>The Grub Street Journal</i>) &#8220;ply about
Ludgate Hill, pulling and forcing the people
to some peddling alehouse or a brandy-shop
to be married, even on a Sunday stopping
them as they go to church, and almost
tearing their clothes off their backs.&#8221; If
you drove Fleetwards with matrimony in
your eye, why, then you were fair game:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Scarce had the coach discharg&#8217;d its trusty fare,</div>
<div class="verse">But gaping crowds surround th&#8217; amorous pair.</div>
<div class="verse">The busy plyers make a mighty stir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">And whisp&#8217;ring, cry, &#8220;D&#8217;ye want the Parson, Sir?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Yet the great bulk of Fleet marriages
were in their own way orderly and respectable.
Poor people found them shortest and
cheapest. Now and again there are glimpses
of rich or high-born couples: as, in 1744,
the Hon. H. Fox with Georgina Caroline,
eldest daughter of Charles, second Duke of
Richmond, of which union Charles James
was issue. One odd species was a parish
wedding: the churchwardens thought it an
ingenious device to bribe some blind or halting
youth, the burden of a neighbouring
parish, to marry a female pauper chargeable
to them; for, being a wife she immediately
acquired her husband&#8217;s settlement, and they
were rid of her. In one case they gave
forty shillings and paid the expense of a
Fleet marriage; the rag, tag, and bobtail
attended in great numbers and a mighty
racket was the result. According to the law
then and long after, a woman by marrying
transferred the burden of her debts to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
husband. So some desperate spinsters hied
them Fleetwards to dish their creditors;
plyer or Parson soon fished up a man; and
though, under different <i>aliases</i>, he were
already wived like the Turk, what mattered
it? The wife had her &#8220;lines,&#8221; and how to
prove the thing a sham? Husbands, again,
had a reasonable horror of their wives&#8217; antenuptial
obligations. An old superstition,
widely prevalent in England, was that if you
took nothing by your bride you escaped
liability. Obviously, then, the thing to do
was to marry her in what Winifred Jenkins
calls &#8220;her birthday soot,&#8221; or thereabouts.
So &#8220;the woman ran across Ludgate Hill in
a shift,&#8221; for thus was her state of destitution
made patent to all beholders.</p>

<p>When the royal fleet came in, the crews,
&#8220;panged&#8221; full of gold and glory, made
straight for the taverns of Ratcliffe Highway,
and of them, there footing it with their
Polls and Molls, some one asked, &#8220;Why not
get married?&#8221; Why not, indeed? Coaches
are fetched; the party make off to the
Fleet; plyers, Parsons, and publicans, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
welcome them with open arms; the knots are
tied in less than no time; there is punch
with the officiating cleric; the unblushing
fair are crammed into the coaches; Jack, his
pocket lighter, his brain heavier, climbs up
on the box or holds on behind; the populace
acclaims the procession with old shoes, dead
cats, and whatever Fleet Ditch filth comes
handy; and so back to their native <i>Radcliffe</i>,
to spend their honeymoon in &#8220;fiddling,
piping, jigging, eating,&#8221; and to end the bout
with a divorce even less ceremonious than
their nuptials. &#8220;It is a common thing,&#8221;
reports a tavern-keeper of that sea-boys&#8217;
paradise, &#8220;when a fleet comes in to have two
or three hundred marriages in a week&#8217;s time
among the sailors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work was mostly done cheap: the
Parson took what he could get, and every one
concerned must have his little bit. Thus,
&#8220;the turnkey had a shilling, Boyce (the
acting clerk) had a shilling, the plyer had a
shilling, and the Parson had three and sixpence&#8221;&mdash;the
total amounting to six shillings
and sixpence. This was a fair average,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
though now and again the big-wigs netted
large sums.</p>

<p>A Fleet marriage was as valid as another;
but in trials for bigamy the rub was: Had
there been any marriage at all? Some
accused would strenuously maintain the
negative. In 1737 Richard Leaver was
indicted at the Old Bailey for this offence;
and &#8220;I know nothing about the wedding,&#8221;
was his ingenuous plea. &#8220;I was fuddled overnight
and next morning I found myself
a-bed with a strange woman and &#8216;Who are
you? How came you here?&#8217; says I. &#8216;O,
my dear,&#8217; says she, &#8216;we were marry&#8217;d last
night at the Fleet.&#8217;&#8221; More wonderful still
was the story told by one Dangerfield,
charged the preceding year for marrying
whilst Arabella Fast, his first wife, was still
alive. Arabella and he, so he asserted, had
plotted to blackmail a Parson with whom
the lady entertained relations all too fond.
At ten at night he burst in upon them as
had been arranged. &#8220;&#8216;Hey&#8217; (says I), &#8216;how
came you a-bed with my spouse?&#8217; &#8216;Sir,&#8217;
(says he), &#8216;I only lay with her to keep my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
back warm.&#8217;&#8221; The explanation lacked probability,
and &#8220;in the morning&#8221; the erring
divine acknowledged his mistake:&mdash;&#8220;I must
make you a present if you can produce a
certificate&#8221; (he suspected something wrong,
you see). Dangerfield was gravelled. Not
so the resourceful Arabella. &#8220;&#8216;For a crown
I can get a certificate from the Fleet,&#8217; she
whispered; and &#8216;I gave her a crown, and in
half an hour she brings me a certificate.&#8217;&#8221;
The jury acquitted Dangerfield.</p>

<p>The clergyman said to have officiated in
both cases was the &#8220;famous Dr. Gaynam&#8221;
(so a witness described him), the aforesaid
&#8220;Bishop of Hell.&#8221; How could he recollect
an individual face, he asked, for had he not
married his thousands? But it must be
right if it was in his books: <i>he</i> never altered
or falsified <i>his</i> register. &#8220;It was as fair a
register as any church in England can produce.
I showed it last night to the foreman
of the jury, and my Lord Mayor&#8217;s clerk at
the London punch-house&#8221; (a noted Fleet
tavern): so Gaynam swore at Robert Hussey&#8217;s
trial for bigamy in 1733. A familiar figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
was the &#8220;Bishop&#8221; in Fleet taverns and Old
Bailey witness-box. At Dangerfield&#8217;s trial
neither counsel nor judge was very complimentary
to him; but he was moved not a
whit; he was used to other than verbal
attacks, and some years before this he was
soundly cudgelled at a wedding&mdash;in a dispute
about his fees, no doubt. &#8220;A very lusty,
jolly man,&#8221; in full canonicals, a trifle bespattered
from that Fleet Ditch on whose
banks he had spent many a scandalous
year, his florid person verging on over-ripeness,
even decay, for he vanishes four years
later. Was he not ashamed of himself?
sneered counsel. Whereupon &#8220;he (bowing)
<i>video meliora, deteriora sequor</i>.&#8221; Don&#8217;t you
see the reverend rogue complacently mouthing
his tag? He &#8220;flourished&#8221; &#8217;twixt 1709
and 1740. On the fly-leaf of one of his
pocket-books he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The Great Good Man w<sup>m</sup> fortune may displace,</div>
<div class="verse">May into scarceness fall, but not disgrace,</div>
<div class="verse">His sacred person none will dare profane,</div>
<div class="verse">Poor he may be, but never can be mean,</div>
<div class="verse">He holds his value with the wise and good,</div>
<div class="verse">And prostrate seems as great as when he stood.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>The personal application was obvious;
but alas for fame! Even in Mr. Leslie
Stephen&#8217;s mighty dictionary his record is to
seek.</p>

<p>Time would fail to trace the unholy succession
of Fleet Parsons. There was Edward
Ashwell (1734-1743), &#8220;a most notorious
rogue and impostor.&#8221; There was Peter
Symson (1731-1754), who officiated at the
&#8220;Old Red Hand and Mitre,&#8221; headed his
certificates G.R., and bounced after this
fashion:&mdash;&#8220;Marriages performed by authority
by the Reverend Mr. Symson, educated at
the University of Cambridge, and late Chaplain
to the Earl of Rothes. N.B.&mdash;Without
imposition.&#8221; Then there was James Landow
(1737-1743), late Chaplain to His Majesty&#8217;s
ship <i>Falkland</i>, who advertised &#8220;Marriage
with a licence, certificate, and a crown stamp
at a guinea, at the New Chapel, next door
to the China Shop, near Fleet Bridge, London.&#8221;
Of an earlier race was Mr. Robert
Elborrow (1698-1702): &#8220;a very ancient man
and is master of ye chapple&#8221; (he seems to
have been really &#8220;the Parson of the Fleet&#8221;).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
His chief offence was leaving everything to
his none too scrupulous clerk, Bassett.
There is some mention also of the Reverend
Mr. Nehemiah Rogers, a prisoner, &#8220;but
goes at large to his living in Essex and all
places else.&#8221; Probably they were glad to
get rid of him for &#8220;he has struck and boxed
ye bridegroom in ye Chapple and damned
like any com&#8217;on souldier.&#8221; <i>Mulli praeterea,
quos fama obscura recondit.</i> How to fix the
identity of the &#8220;tall black clergyman&#8221; who,
hard by &#8220;The Cock&#8221; in Fleet Market,
pressed his services on loving couples? Was
he one with the &#8220;tall Clergyman who plies
about the Fleet Gate for Weddings,&#8221; and
who in 1734 was convicted &#8220;of swearing
forty-two Oaths and ordered to pay
£4 2<i>s.</i>&#8221;?</p>

<p>In 1753 Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s Marriage Act
(26 Geo. II. cap. 3) put a sudden stop to
the doings of those worthies. Save in the
case of Jews and Quakers, all marriages
were void unless preceded by banns or licence
and celebrated according to the rites of the
Church of England in a church or chapel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
that communion. The Priest who assisted
at an irregular or clandestine marriage was
guilty of a felony punishable by fourteen
years&#8217; transportation. The Bill was violently
opposed; and, according to Horace Walpole,
was crammed down the throats of both
Houses; but its policy, its effects, as well as
later modifications of the marriage law, are
not for discussion here.</p>

<p>I turn to the registers wherein the doings
of the Fleet Parsons are more or less carefully
recorded. In 1783 most of those still extant
had got into the hands of Mr. Benjamin
Panton. &#8220;They weighed more than a ton&#8221;;
were purchased by the Government for
£260 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and to-day you may inspect
them at Somerset House. There are between
two and three hundred large registers and
a thousand or more pocket-books (<i>temp.</i>
1674-1753). Not merely are the records of
marriages curious in themselves, but also
they are often accompanied by curious comments
from the Parson, clerk, taverner, or
whoever kept the book. The oddest collection
is in a volume of date 1727-1754. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
writer used Greek characters, though his
words are English, and is as frank as Pepys,
and every bit as curious. Here are a few
samples from the lot: &#8220;Had a noise for four
hours about the money&#8221; was to be expected
where there were no fixed rates; but &#8220;stole
my clouthes-brush,&#8221; and &#8220;left a pott of
4 penny to pay,&#8221; and &#8220;ran away with the
scertifycate and left a pint of wine to pay
for,&#8221; were surely cases of exceptional roguery.
Curious couples presented themselves:&mdash;&#8220;Her
eyes very black and he beat about ye
face very much.&#8221; Again, the bridegroom
was a boy of eighteen, the bride sixty-five,
&#8220;brought in a coach by four thumping
ladies&#8221; (the original is briefer and coarser)
&#8220;out of Drury Lane as guests&#8221;; and yet the
Parson had &#8220;one shilling only.&#8221; He fared
even worse at times. Once he married a
couple, money down, &#8220;for half a guinea,&#8221;
after which &#8220;it was extorted out of my
pocket, and for fear of my life delivered.&#8221;
Even a Fleet Parson had his notion of propriety.
&#8220;Behav&#8217;d very indecent and rude
to all,&#8221; is one entry; and &#8220;N.B. behav<sup>d</sup><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
rogueshly. Broke the Coachman&#8217;s Glass,&#8221; is
another. Once his reverence, &#8220;having a
mistrust of some Irish roguery,&#8221; though the
party seemed of better rank than usual,
asked indiscreet questions. The leader
turned on him with the true swagger of
your brutal Georgian bully. &#8220;What was
that to me? G&mdash;&mdash; dem me, if I did not
immediately marry them he would use me
ill; in short, apprehending it to be a conspiracy,
I found myself obliged to marry
them <i>in terrorem</i>.&#8221; Again, he had better
luck on another occasion: &#8220;handsomely
entertained,&#8221; he records; and of a bride of
June 11, 1727, &#8220;the said Rachel, the
prettiest woman I ever saw.&#8221; (You fancy
the smirk wherewith he scrawled that single
record of the long vanished beauty!) He is
less complimentary to other clients. His
&#8220;appear<sup>d</sup> a rogue&#8221; and &#8220;two most notorious
thieves&#8221; had sure procured him a broken
pate had his patrons known! How gleefully
and shamelessly he chronicles his bits of
sharp practice! &#8220;Took them from Brown
who was going into the next door with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
them,&#8221; was after all merely business; but what
follows is <i>not</i>. In 1729 he married Susannah
Hewitt to Abraham Wells, a butcher.
The thing turned out ill; and in 1736 she
came back, and suggested annulment by the
simple expedient of destroying the record;
when &#8220;I made her believe I did so, for which
I had a half a guinea.&#8221; Nor was there much
honour among the crew of thieves. &#8220;Total
three and sixpence, but honest Wigmore
kept all the money so farewell him,&#8221; is an
entry by the keeper of a marriage house,
whom a notorious Fleet Parson had dished.
Another is by a substitute for the same
divine:&mdash;&#8220;Wigmore being sent for but was
drunk, so I was a stopgap.&#8221; I confess to a
sneaking fondness for those entertaining
rascals, but enough of their pranks.</p>

<p>Of the other places where irregular marriages
were celebrated two demand some
notice. One was Keith&#8217;s Chapel in Mayfair,
&#8220;a very bishopric of revenue&#8221; to that notorious
&#8220;marriage broker&#8221; the Reverend
Alexander Keith. His charge was a guinea,
and, being strictly inclusive, covered &#8220;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Licence on a Crown Stamp, Minister&#8217;s and
Clerk&#8217;s fees, together with the certificate.&#8221;
No wonder he did a roaring trade! Keith
seemed a nobler quarry than the common
Fleet Parson, and the ecclesiastical authorities
pursued him in their courts. In October
1742, he was excommunicated: with matchless
impudence he retorted by excommunicating
his persecutors from the Bishop
downwards. Next year they stuck him in
the Fleet; but, through Parsons as reckless
as himself, he continued to &#8220;run&#8221; his chapel.
In 1749 he made his wife&#8217;s death an occasion
for advertisement: the public was informed
that the corpse, being embalmed, was removed
&#8220;to an apothecary&#8217;s in South Audley
Street, where she lies in a room hung with
mourning, and is to continue there until
Mr. Keith can attend her funeral.&#8221; Then
follows an account of the chapel. One
authority states that six thousand marriages
were celebrated there within twelve months;
but this seems incredible. That sixty-one
couples were united the day before Lord
Hardwicke&#8217;s Act became law is like enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Here took place, in 1752, the famous marriage
of the fourth Duke of Hamilton to the
youngest of the &#8220;beautiful Miss Gunnings,&#8221;
&#8220;with a ring of the bed curtain half an hour
after twelve at night,&#8221; as Horace Walpole
tells. And here, in September 1748, at a
like uncanny hour, &#8220;handsome Tracy was
united to the butterman&#8217;s daughter in
Craven Street.&#8221; Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s Act was
elegantly described as &#8220;an unhappy stroke
of fortune&#8221; by our enterprising divine. At
first he threatened another form of competition:&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll
buy two or three acres of
ground and by God I&#8217;ll under-bury them
all.&#8221; But in the end he had to own himself
ruined. He had scarce anything, he moaned,
but bread and water, although he had been
wont to expend &#8220;almost his whole Income
(which amounted yearly to several Hundred
Pounds per Annum) in relieving not only
single distressed Persons, but even whole
Families of wretched Objects of Compassion.&#8221;
The world neither believed nor pitied; and
he died in the Fleet on December 17,
1758.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>Last of all comes the Savoy. There, <i>The
Public Advertiser</i> of January 2, 1754, announced,
marriages were performed &#8220;with
the utmost privacy, decency, and regularity,
the expense not more than one guinea, the
five shilling stamp included. There are five
private ways by land to this chapel, and two
by water.&#8221; The Reverend John Williamson,
&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s Chaplain of the Savoy,&#8221; asserted
that as such he could grant licences;
and despite the Act he went on coupling.
In 1755 he married the enormous number of
one thousand one hundred and ninety; half
the brides being visibly in an interesting
condition. The authorities, having warned
him time and again to no purpose, at last
commenced proceedings. But he evaded
arrest by skipping over roofs and vanishing
through back doors, in a manner inexplicable
to us to-day; and went on issuing
licences, while his curate, Mr. Grierson, did
the actual work at the altar. Grierson,
however, was seized and transported for
fourteen years: then his chief surrendered
(1756), stood his trial, and received a like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sentence; the irregular marriages both had
performed being declared of no effect.</p>

<p>What now were the amorous to do? Well,
there were divers makeshifts. Thus, at
Southampton (<i>temp.</i> 1750), a boat was held
ever ready to sail for Guernsey with any
couple able and willing to pay five pounds.
Ireland did not impress itself on the lovers&#8217;
imagination: it may be that the thought of
that gruesome middle passage &#8220;froze the
genial current of their souls.&#8221; But there
was a North as well as a South Britain; and&mdash;what
was more to the purpose&mdash;the Scots
marriage law was all that heart could wish.
Marriage (it held) is a contract into which
two parties not too young and not too
&#8220;sib&#8221; might enter at any time, all that was
necessary being that each party clearly and
in good faith expressed consent. Neither
writing nor witnesses, however important
for proof, were essential to a valid union.
Not that the Scots law, civil or ecclesiastical,
favoured this happy despatch; but the very
punishment it imposed only tied the knot
tighter. Couples of set purpose confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
their vows, got a small fine inflicted, and
there was legal evidence of their union!
Ecclesiastical discipline was strict enough to
prevent regularly instituted Scots ministers
from assisting at such affairs. But any man
would do (for, after all, he was but a witness),
and the first across the Border as well as
or better than another. Now, by a well-known
principle of international law, the
<i>lex loci contractus</i> governs such contracts:
the marriage being valid in Scotland where
it took place, was also recognised as valid in
England where its celebration would have
been a criminal offence! This was curiously
illustrated early in the century by the case
of Joseph Atkinson. The Border, I must
explain, had all along been given to irregular
marriages, and different localities in Scotland
were used as best suited the parties.
Lamberton Toll Bar, N.B., lay four miles
north of Berwick-on-Tweed; and here our
Atkinson did a thriving business in the
coupling line. One fine day he had gone to
Berwick when a couple sought his service at
the toll-house. A quaint fiction presumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that everybody knows the law; but here it
turned out that nobody did, for the bride
and groom instead of uniting themselves
before the first comer rushed off to Berwick,
and were there wedded by Lamberton. And
not only was the affair a nullity; but the
unfortunate coupler was sentenced to seven
years&#8217; transportation for offending against
the English marriage laws.</p>

<p>Most of them, however, that went North
on marriage bent, took the Carlisle road. A
few miles beyond that city the little river
Sark divides the two countries. Just over
the bridge is the toll-house: a footpath to
the right takes you to Springfield. Till
about 1826 the North road lay through this
village; then, however, the way was changed,
and ran by Gretna Green, which is nine and a
half miles from Carlisle. These two places,
together with the toll-house, are all in
Gretna parish; but of course the best known is
Gretna Green: &#8220;the resort&#8221; (wrote Pennant)
&#8220;of all amorous couples whose union the
prudence of parents or guardians prohibits.&#8221;
The place acquired a world-wide fame: that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
English plays and novels should abound in
references to it, as they had done to the
Fleet, was only natural; but one of George
Sand&#8217;s heroes elopes thither with a banker&#8217;s
daughter, and even Victor Hugo hymns it in
melodious verse, albeit his pronunciation is a
little peculiar:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">La mousse des près exhale</div>
<div class="verse">Avril, qui chante drin, drin,</div>
<div class="verse">Et met une succursale</div>
<div class="verse">De Cythère à Gretna Green.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And how to explain the fact that people
hurried from the remotest parts of Scotland
as well as from England, though any square
yard of soil &#8220;frae Maidenkirk to Johnny
Groat&#8217;s&#8221; had served their purpose just as
well? The parishioners, indeed, sought not
the service of their self-appointed priest;
but is there not an ancient saying as to the
prophet&#8217;s lack of honour among his own
people?</p>

<p>Now, if you travelled North in proper
style, in a chaise and four, with post-boys
and so forth, you went to the &#8220;King&#8217;s
Head&#8221; at Springfield, or, after the change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of road, more probably to Gretna Hall; but
your exact halting-place was determined at
Carlisle. The postillions there, being in
league with one or other of the Gretna innkeepers,
took you willy-nilly to one or the
other hostelry. Were you poor and tramped
it, you were glad to get the knot tied at the
toll-house. Most of the business fell into a
few hands. Indeed, the landlords of the
various inns instead of performing the rite
themselves usually sent for a so-called
priest. A certificate after this sort was
given to the wedded couple:&mdash;&#8220;Kingdom of
Scotland, County of Dumfries, Parish of
Gretna: these are to certify to all whom it
may concern that (here followed the names)
by me, both being present and having declared
to me that they are single persons,
have now been married after the manner of
the law of Scotland.&#8221; This the parties and
their witnesses subscribed.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to trace the obscure
succession of Gretna Green priests. Joseph
Paisley, who died in 1811, aged eighty-four,
was, it seems, the original blacksmith; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was no son of Tubal Cain, though he had
been fisher, smuggler, tobacconist. He united
man with woman even as the smith welds iron
with iron&mdash;thus the learned explain his title.
After Paisley, and connected with him by
marriage, there was Robert Elliott, and
several people of the name of Laing. In
some rather amusing memoirs Elliott assures
us that between 1811 and 1839 he performed
three thousand eight hundred and seventy-two
marriages; also that his best year was
1825, when he did one hundred and ninety-eight,
and his worst 1839, when he did but
forty-two. At the toll-bar there was a
different line, whose most picturesque figure
was Gordon, the old soldier. Gordon officiated
in full regimentals, a large cocked hat on his
head and a sword by his side. Here, too,
Beattie reigned for some years before 1843.
His occupation went to his head, for latterly
he had a craze for marrying, so that he would
creep up behind any chance couple and begin
to mumble the magic words that made them
one. The law has ever terrors for the unlettered,
and the rustic bachelor fled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Beattie&#8217;s approach, as if he had been the
pest. The &#8220;priests&#8221; sometimes used a
mangled form of the Church of England
service: which irreverence was probably
intended as a delicate compliment to the
nationality of most of their clients. The
fees were uncertain. When the trembling
parties stood hand in hand in inn or toll-bar,
whilst the hoofs of pursuing post-horses
thundered ever nearer, ever louder, or it
might be that irate father or guardian
battered at the door, it was no time to
bargain. The &#8220;priest&#8221; saw his chance;
and now and again he pouched as much as a
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Each house had its record of famous
marriages. There was the story of how
Lord Westmoreland sought the hand of the
heiress of Child, the banker, and was repulsed
with &#8220;Your blood, my Lord, is good,
but money is better.&#8221; My Lord and the
young lady were speedily galloping towards
the border, while Mr. Child &#8220;breathed hot
and instant on their trace.&#8221; He had caught
them too, but his leader was shot down or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his carriage disabled by some trick (the
legends vary), and he was too late after all.
He made the best of it, of course, and in due
time Lady Sophia Fane, daughter of the
marriage, inherited grandpa&#8217;s fortune and
his bank at Temple Bar. Odder still was
the marriage, in 1826, of Edward Gibbon
Wakefield to Ellen Turner. It was brought
about by an extraordinary fraud, and a week
after the far from happy couple were run
to earth at Calais by the bride&#8217;s relatives.
They &#8220;quoted William and Mary upon me
till I was tired of their Majesties&#8217; names,&#8221; was
Wakefield&#8217;s mournful excuse for submitting
to a separation. He was afterwards tried
for abduction, found guilty, and sentenced to
three years&#8217; imprisonment; while a special
Act of Parliament (7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 66)
declared the marriage null and void. Wakefield
ended strangely as a political economist.
Is not his &#8220;theory of colonisation&#8221; writ large
in all the text books? A pair of Lord High
Chancellors must conclude our list. In
November 1772, John Scott, afterwards Lord
Eldon, was married at Blackshiels, in East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Lothian, to Bessie Surtees, the bridegroom
being but twenty-one. Though the Rev.
Mr. Buchanan, minister of an Episcopal congregation
at Haddington, officiated, it was a
runaway match and an irregular marriage.
Lord Erskine, about October 1818, was
wedded at the &#8220;King&#8217;s Head,&#8221; Springfield,
to Miss Mary Buck (said to have been his
housekeeper). He was about seventy, and,
one fears, in his dotage. A number of extravagant
legends still linger as to the ceremony.
He was dressed in woman&#8217;s clothes,
and played strange pranks. He and his intended
spouse had with them in the coach a
brace of merry-begots (as our fathers called
them), over whom he threw his cloak during
the ceremony in order to make them his
heirs. It is still a vulgar belief in the North
that if the parents of children born out of
wedlock are married, the offspring, to be
legitimised, must be held under their mother&#8217;s
girdle through the nuptial rites. Now, by
the law of Scotland, such a marriage produces
the effect noted; but the presence or
absence of the children is void of legal consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
As far as is known, Erskine had
one son called Hampden, born December 5,
1821, and no other by Mary Buck. It is
worth noting that Robert Burns, on his road
to Carlisle in 1787, fell in by the way &#8220;with
a girl and her married sister&#8221;; and &#8220;the
girl, after some overtures of gallantry on my
side, sees me a little cut with the bottle, and
offers to take me in for a Gretna Green
affair.&#8221; Burns was already wed, Scots fashion,
to Jean Armour. And the thing did not
come off, so that bigamy is not to be reckoned
among the poet&#8217;s sins.</p>

<p>They were rather sordid affairs in the end,
those Gretna Green marriages. So, at least,
the Reverend James Roddick, minister of
the parish, writing of the place in 1834 in
the <i>New Statistical Account</i>, would have us
believe. There were three or four hundred
marriages annually: &#8220;the parties are chiefly
from the sister kingdom and from the lowest
rank of the population.&#8221; A number came
from Carlisle at fair-time, got married, spent
a few days together, and then divorced themselves.
Competition had brought down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
priest&#8217;s fee to half-a-crown, and every tippling-house
had its own official. Nay, the
very roadman on the highway that joined
the kingdoms pressed his services on all
and sundry! And then the railway came
to Gretna, and you had the spectacle of
&#8220;priests&#8221; touting on the platform. Alas for
those shores of old Romance! In 1856, Lord
Brougham&#8217;s Act (19 &amp; 20 Vict. cap. 96),
made well-nigh as summary an end of Gretna
as Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s had of the Fleet unions.
It provided that at least one of the parties
to an irregular Scots marriage must be
domiciled in Scotland, or have resided there
during the twenty-one days immediately
preceding the espousals; else were they
altogether void. What an enemy your
modern law-giver is to the picturesque! And
what an entertaining place this world must
once have been!</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Leges marchiarum</span></i>, to wit, the Laws of the
Marches; so statesmen and lawyers named
the codes which said, though oft in vain,
how English and Scots Borderers should
comport themselves, and how each kingdom
should guard against the other&#8217;s deadly unceasing
enmity. I propose to outline these
laws, and the officials by whom and courts
wherein they were enforced.</p>

<p>But first a word as to country and people.
From Berwick to the Solway&mdash;the extreme
points of the dividing line between North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and South Britain&mdash;is but seventy miles in
a crow&#8217;s flight. But trace its windings, and
you measure one hundred and ten. Over
more than half of this space the division is
arbitrary. It happed where the opposing
forces balanced. The Scot pushed his way
a little farther south here, was pushed back a
little farther north there; and commissioners
and treaties indelibly marked the spots. The
conflict lasted over three centuries, and must
obviously be fiercest on the line where the
kingdoms met. If it stiffened, yet warped,
the Scots&#8217; character, and prevented the
growth of commerce and tilth and comfort
in Scotland proper, what must have been its
effect on the Scots Borderer, ever in the
hottest of the furnace? The weaker, poorer,
smaller kingdom felt the struggle far more
than England, yet the English were worse
troubled than the Scots Borders: being the
richer, they were the more liable to incursion;
their dalesmen were not greatly
different from other Englishmen; they were
kept in hand by a strong central authority;
they had thriving towns and a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
standard of wealth and comfort. Now, the
Scots clansmen developed unchecked; so it is
mainly from them that we take our ideas of
Border life.</p>

<p>The Border country is a pleasant pastoral
land, with soft, rounded hills, and streams
innumerable, and secluded valleys, where the
ruins of old peels or feudal castles intimate a
troubled past. That past, however, has left
a precious legacy to letters, for the Border
ballads are of the finest of the wheat. They
preserve, as only literature can, the joys and
sorrows, the aspirations, hopes and fears, and
beliefs of other days and vanished lives.
They are voices from the darkness, yet we oft
feel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He had himself laid hand on sword</div>
<div class="verse">He who this rime did write!</div>
</div></div>

<p>The most of them have no certain time or
place. Even the traditional stories help but
little to make things clear. Yet they tell
us more, and tell it better, than the dull
records of the annalists. We know who
these men really were&mdash;a strong, resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
race, passionate and proud, rough and cruel,
living by open robbery, yet capable of deathless
devotion, faithful to their word, hating
all cowards and traitors to the death; not
without a certain respect and admiration for
their likes across the line, fond of jest and
song, equal on occasion to a certain rude
eloquence; and, before all, the most turbulent
and troublesome. The Scots Borderers
were dreaded by their own more peaceful
countrymen; and to think of that narrow
strip of country, hemmed in by the Highlands
to the north and the Border clans on
the south, is to shudder at the burden <i>it</i> had
to endure. For a race, whatever its good
qualities, that lives by rapine, is like to be
dangerous to friends as well as foes. Some
Border clans, as the Armstrongs and the
Elliots, were girded at as &#8220;always riding&#8221;;
and they were not particular as to whom they
rode against. Nay, both governments suspected
the Borderers of an inexplicable
tenderness for their neighbours. When
they took part in a larger expedition, they
would attack each other with a suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
lack of heart. At best they were apt to
look at war from their own point of view,
and fight for mere prisoners or plunder.</p>

<p>To meet such conditions the Border Laws
were evolved. They were administered in
chief by special officers called Wardens.
Either Border was portioned out into three
Marches: the East, the Middle, and the
West (the Lordship of Liddesdale was included
in the Scots Middle March, but sometimes
it had a special Keeper of almost equal
dignity with a Warden.) Each of the three
Scots Wardens had a hundred pounds of
yearly fee; he could appoint deputies, captains
of strongholds, clerks, sergeants, and
dempsters; he could call out the full force
of his district to invade or beat back invasion;
he represented the Sovereign, and was
responsible for crimes. He must keep the
Border clans in order by securing as hostages
several of their most conspicuous sons, and
either these were quartered on nobles on the
other side of the Firth, or they were held in
safer keeping in the king&#8217;s castles. He also
held Justice Courts for the trial of Scots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
subjects accused of offences against the laws
of their own country. He was commonly a
great noble of the district, his office in early
times being often hereditary; and, as such
noble, he had power of life and death, so that
the need for holding special courts was little
felt. A pointed Scots anecdote pictures an
angry Highlander &#8220;banning&#8221; the Lords of
Session as &#8220;kinless loons,&#8221; because, though
some were relatives, they had decided a case
against him. These Wardens were <i>not</i>
&#8220;kinless loons,&#8221; and they often used their
office to favour a friend or depress a foe.
On small pretext they put their enemies &#8220;to
the horn,&#8221; as the process of outlawry (by
trumpet blast) was called. True, the indifference
with which those enemies &#8220;went to the
horn&#8221; would scandalise the legal pedants.</p>

<p>Sometimes a superior officer, called &#8220;Lieutenant,&#8221;
was sent to the Borders; the
Wardens were under him; he more fully
represented the royal power. Now and
again the Sovereign himself made a progress,
administering a rough and ready justice, and
so &#8220;dantoning the thieves of the Borders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and making the rush bush keep the cow.&#8221;
So it was said of James V.&#8217;s famous raid in
1529. The chief incident was the capture
of Johnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, the ruins
of whose picturesque tower at the Hollows
still overlook the Esk. Gilnockie came to
meet his King with a great band of horsemen
richly apparelled. He was captain of
Langholm Castle, and the ballad tells how
he and his companions exercised themselves
in knightly sports on Langholm Lee, whilst
&#8220;The ladies lukit frae their loft windows.
&#8216;God bring our men well hame agen!&#8217;&#8221; the
ladies said; and their apprehensions were
more than justified, for Johnie&#8217;s reception
was not so cordial as he expected. &#8220;What
wants yon knave that a King should have?&#8221;
asked James in angry amaze, as he ordered
the band to instant execution. Gilnockie
and company were presently strung up on
some convenient yew-trees at Carlenrig,
though, in accordance with romantic precedent,
one is said to have escaped to tell the
tale. Many of Johnie&#8217;s name, among them
Ill Will Armstrong, tersely described as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
&#8220;another stark thieff,&#8221; went to their doom;
but the act, however applauded at Edinburgh,
was bitterly condemned on the
Borders. Gilnockie only plundered the
English, it was urged, and the King had
caught him by a trick unworthy a Stuart.
The country folk loved to tell how the dule-trees
faded away, and they loved to point
out the graves of the Armstrongs in the
lonely churchyard. But the stirring ballad
preserves the name better than all else.
It unblushingly commends Gilnockie&#8217;s love of
honesty, his generosity, his patriotism, and
directly accuses his Sovereign of treachery,
in which accusation there is perhaps some
truth. Anyhow, his execution was the
violent act of a weak man, and had no permanent
effect.</p>

<p>The Wardens had twofold duties: first,
that of defence against the enemy; second,
that of negotiation in times of peace with
their mighty opposites. Thus the Border laws
were part police and part international,
and were administered in different courts.
Offences of the first class were speaking or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
conferring with Englishmen without permission
of the King or the Warden, and the
warning Englishmen of the Scots&#8217; alertness
in the matter of forays. In brief, aiding,
abetting, or in any way holding intercourse
with the &#8220;auld enemy&#8221; was march
treason (to adopt a convenient English
term).</p>

<p>In England the Wardens were finally
chosen for their political and military skill,
not because of their territorial position.
Now, the Warden of the East Marches was
commonly Governor and Castellan of Berwick.
The castle of Harbottell was allotted to
the Warden of the Middle Marches;
whilst for the West, Carlisle, where again
Governor and Warden were often one, was
the appointed place. Sometimes a Lord
warden-general was appointed, sometimes a
Lieutenant, but the Wardens were commonly
independent. At the Warden courts
Englishmen were punished for march
treason, a branch of which was furnishing
the Scots with articles of merchandise or
war. And here I note that Carlisle throve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
on this illegal traffic. At Carlisle Fair the
Carlisle burgher never asked the nationality
of man or beast. The first got his money
or its equivalent; the second was instantly
passed through the hands of butcher and
skinner. Though the countryside were
wasted, the burghers lay safe within their
strong walls, and waxed fat on the spoils of
borderman and dalesman alike. Small
wonder the city was &#8220;Merrie Carlisle.&#8221;
The law struck with as little force against
blackmail, or protection money, which it
was an offence to pay to any person, Scots
or English. From this source, Gilnockie
and others, coining the terror of their name,
drew great revenue. Another provision was
against marriage with a Scotswoman without
the Warden&#8217;s consent, for in this way
traitors, or &#8220;half-marrows,&#8221; arose within the
gate. Complete forms are preserved of the
procedure at those Warden courts. There
were a grand jury and an ordinary jury, and
the Warden acted very much as a judge of
to-day. One or two technical terms I shall
presently explain. Here I but note that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
criminal guilty of march treason was beheaded
&#8220;according to the customs of the
marches.&#8221;</p>

<p>The international duties of the Wardens
were those of conference with each other, and
the redressing of approved wrongs, which
wrongs were usually done in raids or forays.
Of these I must now give some account.
The smaller Border chieftain dwelt in a peel
tower, stuck on the edge of a rock or at the
break of a torrent. It was a rude structure
with a projecting battlement. A stair or
ladder even held its two stories together, and
about it lay a barnkin&mdash;a space of some sixty
feet encompassed by a wall; the laird&#8217;s
followers dwelling in huts hard by. For
small parties the tower was self-sufficient in
defence, and if it lay in the way of a hostile
army, the laird was duly warned by scouts or
beacon fires, and withdrew to some fastness
of rock or marsh, carrying his few valuables,
driving his live stock before him, leaving the
foeman nothing to burn and nothing to take
away. With his followers he lived on milk,
meat, and barley, together with the spoils of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the forest and stream. The marchmen are
reported temperate&mdash;no doubt from necessity.
Their kine, recruited by forays, were herded
in a secluded part of the glen, and when the
herd waxed small, and the laird was tired of
hunting, and his women lusted after new
ornament, and old wounds were healed, and
the retainers were growing rusty, then it was
time for a raid. Was the laird still inactive?
In struck his lady&#8217;s sharper wit, and the story
goes that Wat Scott of Harden was ever
and anon served with a dish which, being
uncovered, revealed a pair of <i>polished</i> spurs.
Thus his wife, Mary Scott, the &#8220;Flower of
Yarrow&#8221;&mdash;a very practical person, despite
her romantic name&mdash;urged him to profitable
rapine. Well: his riders were bidden to a
trysting-place; and hither, armed in jacks
(which are leathern jerkins plated with iron)
and mounted on small but active and hardy
horses, they repaired at evenfall. The laird
and some superior henchmen wore also sleeves
of mail and steel bonnets; all had long
lances, swords, axes, and in later times such
rude firearms&mdash;serpentines, half-haggs, harquebusses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
currys, cullivers, and hand-guns
are mentioned&mdash;as were to be had. In the
mirk night the reivers crossed the Border;
and to do this unseen was no easy matter.
The whole line from Berwick to Carlisle was
patrolled by setters and searchers, watchers
and overseers, having sleuth-hounds to track
the invader; also, many folk held lands by
the tenure of cornage, and by blowing horns
must warn the land of coming raids. Where
the frontier line was a river the fords were
carefully guarded; those held unnecessary
were staked up; narrow passes were blocked
in divers ways, so that chief element in
Border craft was the knowledge of paths and
passes through moorland and moss, and of
nooks and coigns of security deep in the
mountain glens.</p>

<p>Our party crosses in safety and makes to
one of those hidden spots, as near as may be
to the scene of action. Here it rests and
refreshes itself during the day, and next
night it swoops down on its appointed foray.
The chief quest was ever cattle, which were
eatable and portable. But your moss-trooper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
was not particular. He took everything
inside and outside house and byre.
Many lists are preserved of things lifted,
whereof one notes a shroud and children&#8217;s
clothes. A sleuth-hound was a choice prize.
Possibly its abduction touched the Borderer&#8217;s
sense of humour. Scott of Harden, escaping
from a raid, with &#8220;a bow of kye and a
bassen&#8217;d (brindled) bull,&#8221; passed a trim haystack.
He sighed as he thought of the lack
of fodder in his own glen. &#8220;Had ye but
four feet ye should not stand lang there,&#8221; he
muttered as he hurried onwards. Not to
him, not to any rider was it given to tarry by
the way, for the dalesmen were not the folk
to sit down under outrage. The warder, as
he looked from the &#8220;Scots gate&#8221; of Carlisle
castle, and saw the red flame leaping forth
into the night from burning homestead or
hamlet, was quick to warn the countryside
that a reiving expedition was afoot. Even
though the prey were lifted unobserved, that
only caused a few hours&#8217; delay, and soon a
considerable body, carrying a lighted piece
of turf on a spear, as a sign, was instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
on the invader&#8217;s trace. This &#8220;following of
the fraye&#8221; was called &#8220;hot-trod,&#8221; and was
done with hound and horn, and hue and cry.
Certain privileges attached to the &#8220;hot-trod.&#8221;
If the offender was caught red-handed he
was executed; or, if thrift got the better of
rage, he was held to ransom. As early as
1276 a curious case is reported from Alnwick,
of a Scot attacking one Semanus, a
hermit, and taking his clothes and one
penny! Being presently seized, the culprit
was beheaded by Semanus in person, who
thus recovered his goods and took vengeance
of his wrong. A later legend illustrates the
more than summary justice that was done.
The Warden&#8217;s officers having taken a body
of prisoners, asked my Lord his pleasure.
His Lordship&#8217;s mind was &#8220;ta&#8217;en up wi&#8217; affairs
o&#8217; the state,&#8221; and he hastily wished the
whole set hanged for their untimely intrusion.
Presently he was horrified to find that
his imprecations had been taken as literal
commands, and literally obeyed. Even if the
reivers gained their own border, the law of
&#8220;hot-trod&#8221; permitted pursuit within six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
days of the offence. The pursuer, however,
must summon some reputable man of the
district entered to witness his proceedings.
Nay, the inhabitants generally must assist
him&mdash;at least, the law said so.</p>

<p>But if all failed, the <i>Leges Marchiarum</i>
had still elaborate provisions to meet his
case. He had a shrewd guess who were his
assailants. The more noted moss-troopers
were &#8220;kenspeckle folk.&#8221; The very fact that
so many had the same surname caused them
to be distinguished by what were called &#8220;to-names,&#8221;
based on some physical or moral
characteristic, which even to-day photographs
the man for us. Such were Eddie Great-legs,
Jock Half-lugs, Red-neb Hob, Little
Jock Elliott, Wynkyng Wyll, Wry-crag, Ill
Wild Will, Evil Willie, David the Leddy,
Hob the King; or some event in a man&#8217;s
history provided a &#8220;to-name.&#8221; Ill Drooned
Geordy, you fancy, had barely escaped a
righteous doom, and Archie Fire-the-Braes
was sure a swashbuckler of the first magnitude.
Others derived from their father&#8217;s
name.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir Thomas Maitland, who has preserved
some of these appellations in his
<i>Complainte Aganis the Thievis of Liddisdail</i>,
apparently the only weapon he&mdash;though
Scots Chancellor&mdash;could use against them.
Other names, the chroniclers affirm, are more
expressive still; but modern prudery forbids
their recovery. They were good enough
headmark, whatever their quality; and a
harried household had but to hear one
shouted in or after the harrying to know
who the harriers were. The slogan, or war-cry,
of the clan would rap out in the excitement,
and there again he knew his men.
The cross of St. Andrew showed them to be
Scots, the cross of St. George affirmed them
English. A letter sewn in a cap, a kerchief
round the arm, were patent identification.
The chieftain&#8217;s banner was borne now and
again, even in a daylight foray&mdash;a mode
affected by the more daring spirits.</p>

<p>Divining in some sort his spoiler, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
aggrieved and plundered sought legal redress.
Now the Laws of the Marches, agreed on by
royal commissioners from the two kingdoms,
regulated intercourse from early times. Thus
as early as 1249, eleven knights of Northumberland,
and as many from the Scots Border,
drew up a rough code: for the recovery of
debts, the surrender of fugitive bondsmen,
and the trial by combat of weightier matters
in dispute. All Scotsmen, save the king
and the bishops of St. Andrews and
Dunkeld, accused of having committed a
crime in England, must fight their accuser
at certain fixed places on the Marches; and
there were corresponding provisions when
the accused was an Englishman. What
seems a form of the <i>judicium Dei</i> appears in
another provision. An animal said to be
stolen, being brought to the Tweed or the
Esk, where either formed the boundary, was
driven into the water. If the beast sank the
defendant paid. If it swam to the farther
shore, the claimant had him as his own. If
it scrambled back to the bank whence it
started, the accused might (perchance) retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
it with a clear conscience. But as to this
event the record is silent; and, indeed, the
whole business lacks intelligibility. The
combats, however, were many, and were
much denounced by the clergy, who had
to provide a champion, and were heavily
mulcted if he lost. The priest suffered no
more than the people; but he could better
voice his wrongs. All such things were
obviously adaptations of the trial by
ordeal, or by combat, and the treason
duel of chivalry, to the rough life of the
Border. Again, the matter was settled, even
in late times, by the oath of the accused.
The prisoner was sworn:&mdash;&#8220;By Heaven
above you, Hell beneath you, by your part
of Paradise, by all that God made in six
days and seven nights, and by God Himself,&#8221;
that he was innocent. In a superstitious
age this might have some effect;
and there was ever the fear of being
branded as perjured. But it can have
been used only when there was no proof,
or when the doubt was very grave: when
the issue, that is, seemed as the cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of a knot, the loosing whereof passed man&#8217;s
wit.</p>

<p>In the century preceding the Union of the
Crowns, the international code was very
highly developed, and the procedure was
strictly defined. As England was the larger
nation, and as its law was in a more highly
developed and more firm and settled state,
its methods were followed on the whole.
The injured party sent a bill of complaint
to his own Warden; and the bill, even as
put into official form, was simplicity itself.
It said that A. complained upon B. for that&mdash;and
then followed a list of the stolen
goods, or the wrongs done. It was verified
by the complainant&#8217;s oath, and thereafter
sent to the opposite Warden, whose duty was
to arrest the accused or at least to give him
notice to attend on the next Day of Truce.
[One famous fray (June 17, 1575) is commemorated
in <i>The Raid of the Reidswire</i>, a
ballad setting forth many features of a Day of
Truce.] The Wardens agreed on the Day, and
the place was usually in the northern kingdom,
where most of the defendants lived. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
meeting was proclaimed in all the market
towns on either side. The parties, each
accompanied by troops of friends, came in;
and a messenger from the English side
demanded that assurance should be kept till
sunrise the following day. This was granted
by the Scots, who proceeded to send a similar
message, and were presently secured by a
similar assurance. Then each Warden held
up his hand as a sign of faith, and made
proclamation of the Day to his own side (the
evident purpose of this elaborate ritual was
to keep North and South from flying, on
sight, at each other&#8217;s throats). The English
Warden now came to his Scots brother,
whom he saluted and embraced; and the
business of the Day of Truce (or Diet, or
Day Marche, or Warden Court, as it was
variously called) began. That business was
commerce, and pleasure, as well as law.
Merchants come with their wares; booths
were run up; a brisk trade ran in articles
tempting to the savage eye. Both sides
were ready for the moment to forget their
enmities. If they could not fight, they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
play, and football was ever your Borderers&#8217;
favourite pastime (from the desperate mauls
which mark that exhilarating sport as
practised along the Border line, one fancies
that the &#8220;auld riding bluid&#8221; still stirs in
the veins of the players). Gambling, too,
was a popular excitement. There was much
of feasting and drinking, and sure some
Border Homer, poor and old and blind, even
as him of Chios, was there to charm and
melt his rude hearers with the storied loves
and wars of other days. The conclave fairly
hummed with pleasure and excitement.
Yet with such inflammable material, do you
wonder that the meeting ended now and
again in most admired disorder?</p>

<p>For our bill of complaint, it might be
tried in more than one way. It might be by
&#8220;the honour of the Warden,&#8221; who often had
knowledge, personal or acquired, of the case,
and felt competent to decide the matter off-hand.
On his first appearance he had taken
an oath (yearly renewed) in presence of the
opposite Warden and the whole assemblage
to do justice, and he now officially &#8220;fyled&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
or &#8220;cleared the bill&#8221; (as the technical
phrase ran) by writing on it the words
&#8220;foull (or &#8216;clear&#8217;), as I am verily persuaded
upon my conscience and honour&#8221;&mdash;a
deliverance after the method wherein
individual peers give their voice at a trial of
one of their order. This did not of necessity
end the matter, for the complainant could
present a new bill and get the verdict of a
jury thereon, which also was the proper
tribunal where the Warden declined to
interfere. It was thus chosen: The English
Warden named and swore in six Scots, the
Scots Warden did the like to six Englishmen.
The oath ran in these terms:&mdash;&#8220;Yea
shall cleare noe bill worthie to be fild, yea
shall file no bill worthie to be cleared,&#8221; and
so forth. Warden sergeants were appointed
who led the jury to a retired place; the bills
were presented; and the jurymen fell to
work. It would seem that they did so in
two sections, each considering complaints
against its own nationality. If the bill was
&#8220;fyled,&#8221; the word &#8220;foull&#8221; was written upon
it (of course, a verdict of guilty); but how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to get such a verdict under such conditions?
The assize had more than a fellow-feeling
for the culprit: like the jury in Aytoun&#8217;s
story, they might think that Flodden (then
no distant memory) was not yet avenged.
There were divers expedients to this end.
Commissioners were sometimes appointed by
the two crowns to solve a difficulty a Warden
Court had failed to adjust. Again, it was
strangely provided that &#8220;If the accused be
not quitt by the oathe of the assize it is a
conviction.&#8221; One very stubborn jury (<i>temp.</i>
1596) sat for a day, a night, and a day on
end, &#8220;almost to its undoeinge.&#8221; The
Warden, enraged at such conduct and
yet fearing for the men&#8217;s lives, needs must
discharge them. I ought to mention an
alleged third mode of trial by vower, who,
says Sir Walter Scott, was an umpire to
whom the dispute was referred. Rather was
he a witness of the accused&#8217;s own nation.
Some held such evidence essential to conviction;
if honest, it was practically conclusive.</p>

<p>Well! Suppose the case too clear and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
man too friendless, and the jury &#8220;fyled&#8221; the
bill. If the offence were capital, the prisoner
was kept in safe custody, and was hanged or
beheaded as soon as possible. But most
affairs were not capital. Thus the Border
Law forbad hunting in the other kingdom
without the express leave of the owner of
the soil. Just such an unlicensed hunting is
the theme of <i>Chevy Chase</i>. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The Percy owt of Northumberland,</div>
<div class="indent">And a vow to God mayd he,</div>
<div class="verse">That he wolde hunte in the mountayns</div>
<div class="indent">Off Cheviot within dayes thre,</div>
<div class="verse">In the mauger of doughty Douglas,</div>
<div class="indent">And all that ever with him be.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Douglas took a summary mode of redress
where a later and tamer owner had lodged
his bill. In a common case of theft, if the
offender were not present (the jury would
seem to have tried cases in absence), the
Warden must produce him at the next Day
of Truce. Indeed, whilst the jury was deliberating,
the officials were going over the
bills &#8220;filed&#8221; on the last Day, and handing
over each culprit to the opposite Warden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
or sureties were given for him; or the
Warden delivered his servant as pledge. If
the pledge died, the body was carried to the
next Warden Court.</p>

<p>The guilty party, being delivered up, must
make restitution within forty days or suffer
death, whilst aggravated cases of &#8220;lifting&#8221;
were declared capital. In practice a man
taken in fight or otherwise was rarely put to
death. Captive and captor amicably discussed
the question of ransom. That fixed,
the captive was allowed to raise it; if
he failed he honourably surrendered. The
amount of restitution was the &#8220;Double and
Salffye,&#8221; to wit, three times the value of the
original goods, two parts being recompense,
and the third costs or expenses. Need I say
that this triple return was too much for
Border honesty? Sham claims were made,
and these, for that they obliged the Wardens
&#8220;to speire and search for the thing that
never was done,&#8221; were rightly deemed a great
nuisance. As the bills were sworn to, each
false charge involved perjury; and in 1553
it was provided that the rascal claimants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
should be delivered over to the tender
mercies of the opposite Warden. Moreover,
a genuine bill might be grossly exaggerated
(are claims against insurance and railway
companies always urged with accuracy of
detail?). If it were disputed, the value was
determined by a mixed jury of Borderers.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to refer to Border
faith. In 1569 the Earl of Northumberland
was implicated in a rising against Elizabeth.
Fleeing north, he took refuge with an Armstrong,
Hector of Harelaw, who sold him
to the Regent Murray. Harelaw&#8217;s name
became a byword and a reproach. He died
despised and neglected; and &#8220;to take Hector&#8217;s
cloak&#8221; was an imputation of treachery years
after the original story had faded. Thus, in
Marchland the deadliest insult against a
man was to say that he had broken faith.
The insult was given in a very formal and
deliberate manner, called a Baugle. The
aggrieved party procured the glove or picture
of the traitor, and whenever there was
a meeting (a Day of Trace was too favourable
an opportunity to be neglected) he gave notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of the breach of faith to friend and foe,
with blast of the horn and loud cries. The
man insulted must give him the lie in his
throat, and a deadly combat ensued. The
Laws of the Marches attempted to substitute
the remedy by bill, that the matter might
not &#8220;goe to the extremyte of a baughle,&#8221;
or where that was impossible, to fix rules for
the thing itself. Or, the Wardens were advised
to attend, with less than a hundred of
retinue, to prevent &#8220;Brawling, buklinge,
quarrelinge, and bloodshed.&#8221; Such things
were a fruitful source of what a Scots Act
termed &#8220;the heathenish and barbarous custom
of Deadly Feud.&#8221; When one slew his
fellow under unfair conditions, the game of
revenge went see-sawing on for generations.
The Border legislators had many ingenious
devices to quench such strife. A Warden
might order a man complained of to sign in
solemn form a renunciation of his feud; and
if he refused, he was delivered to the opposite
Warden till he consented. In pre-Reformation
days the church did something by
enjoining prayer and pilgrimage. A sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
money (Assythement) now and again settled
old scores; or there might be a treaty of
peace cemented by marriage. Sometimes,
again, there was a fight by permission of the
Sovereign. (<i>Cf.</i> the parallel case of the clan-duel
in the <i>Fair Maid of Perth</i>.) Still,
prearranged single combats, duels in fact,
were frequent on the Border. Turner, or
Turnie Holme, at the junction of the Kirshope
and Liddel, was a favourite spot for them.</p>

<p>And now business and pleasure alike are
ended, and the day (fraught with anxiety to
official minds) is waning fast. Proclamation
is made that the multitude may know the
matters transacted. Then it is declared that
the Lord Wardens of England and Scotland,
and Scotland and England (what tender
care for each other&#8217;s susceptibilities!) appoint
the next Day of Truce, which ought not to
be more than forty days hence, at such and
such a place. Then, with solemn salutations
and ponderous interchange of courtesy, each
party turns homeward. As noted, the Truce
lasted till the next sunrise. As the nations
were at peace (else had there been no meeting),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
this recognised the fact that the Borders
were always, more or less, in a state of
trouble. Also it prevented people from
violently righting themselves forthwith. A
curious case in 1596, where this condition
was broken, gave rise to a Border foray of
the most exciting kind, commemorated in
the famous ballad of <i>Kinmont Willie</i>. A
Day of Truce had been held on the Kershope
Burn, and at its conclusion Willie Armstrong
of Kinmont, a noted Scots freebooter, rode
slowly off, with a few companions. Some
taunt, or maybe the mere sight of one who
had done them so much wrong, was too
much for the English party, and Kinmont
was speedily laid by the heels in Carlisle
Castle. Buccleuch was Keeper of Liddisdale.
He had not been present at the Day
of Truce; but when they told him that
Kinmont had been seized &#8220;between the
hours of night and day,&#8221; he expressed his
anger in no uncertain terms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He has ta&#8217;en the table wi&#8217; his hand,</div>
<div class="verse">He garr&#8217;d the red wine spring on hie.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And have they ta&#8217;en him, Kinmont Willie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">Against the truce of Border tide?</div>
<div class="verse">And forgotten that the bauld Buccleuch</div>
<div class="verse">Is keeper here on the Scottish side?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Negociations failing to procure redress,
Buccleuch determined to rescue Kinmont
himself. In the darkness of a stormy night
he and his men stole up to Carlisle, broke
the citadel, rescued Kinmont, and carried
him off in safety, whilst the English lawyers
were raising ingenious technical justifications
(you can read them at length in the collection
of Border Papers) of the capture.
Those same papers show that the ballad
gives the main features of the rescue with
surprising accuracy. But I cannot linger
over its cheerful numbers. The event might
once have provoked a war, but the shadow
of the Union was already cast. James would
do nothing to spoil the splendid prize almost
within his grasp, and Elizabeth&#8217;s statesmen
were not like to quarrel with their future
master.</p>

<p>Half a century before the consummation
one great cause of discord had been removed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
From the junction of the Liddel and Esk to
the Solway was known as the Debateable
Land, a sort of No-Man&#8217;s Land, left in
doubt from the time of Bruce. Both nations
pastured on it from sunrise to sunset, but in
the night any beasts left grazing were lawful
prey to the first comer. Enclosures or houses
on it could be destroyed or burned without
remedy. Apparently the idea was to make
it a &#8220;buffer State&#8221; between the two kingdoms.
It was, however, a thorn in the flesh
to each, for the Bateables, as the in-dwellers
were called, were broken men, and withal
the most desperate ruffians on the Border.
In 1552 a joint Commission divided the
Debateable Land between England and
Scotland. The Bateables were driven out,
and a dyke was built as boundary line. All
the same, here was, for many years, the wildest
in the whole wild whirlpool; so that long
after the Union, when somebody told King
James of a cow which, taken from England

of itself, the British Solomon was sceptical.
It gravelled him, he confessed, to imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
any four-footed thing passing unlifted
through the Debateable Land.</p>

<p>With the death of Elizabeth (1603) came
the Union of the Crowns, and the Scots
riders felt their craft in danger, for they
forthwith made a desperate incursion into
England, with some idea (it is thought) of
staying the event. But they were severely
punished, and needs must cower under the
now all-powerful Crown. The appointment
of effective Wardens presently ceased. In
1606, by the Act 4 Jac. I., cap. 1, the
English Parliament repealed the anti-Scots
laws, on condition that the Scots Parliament
reciprocated; and presently a kindred
measure was touched with the sceptre at
Edinburgh. The administration of the
Border was left to the ordinary tribunals,
and the <i>Leges Marchiarum</i> vanished to the
Lumber Room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> have no doubt, at some time or other,
walked through the Royal Courts of Justice
and admired the Judges in their scarlet or
other bravery. One odd little detail may
have caught your eye: a black patch on the
top differences the wig of the present (1898)
Master of the Rolls from those of his brethren.
It signifies that the wearer is a Serjeant-at-Law,
and when he goes to return no more, with
him will probably vanish the Order of the
Coif. Verily, it will be the &#8220;end o&#8217; an auld
sang,&#8221; of a record stretching back to the
beginning of English jurisprudence, of an
order whose passing had, at one time, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
as the passing of the law itself. Here in bare
outline I set forth its ancient and famous
history. And, first, as to the name. Under
the feudal system land was held from the
Crown upon various tenures. Sometimes
special services were required from the
holders; these were called Serjeants, and a
tenure was said to be by Serjeanty. Special
services, though usually military, now and
again had to do with the administration of
justice. A man enjoyed his plot because he
was coroner, keeper of the peace, summoner,
or what not; and, over and above the land,
he had the fees of the office. A few offices,
chiefly legal, came to have no land attached&mdash;were
only paid in fees. Such a business
was a Serjeanty in gross, or at large, as one
might say. Again, after the Conquest, whilst
the records of our law courts were in Latin,
the spoken language was Norman-French&mdash;a
fearful and wondrous tongue that grew to be&mdash;&#8220;as
ill an hearing in the mouth as law-French,&#8221;
says Milton scornfully&mdash;and indeed
Babel had scarce matched it. But from the
first it must have been a sore vexation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
thick-witted Saxon haled before the tribunal
of his conquerors. He needs must employ a
<i>counter</i>, or man skilled in the <i>conter</i>, as the
pleadings were called. The business was a
lucrative one, so the Crown assumed the
right of regulation and appointment. It was
held for a Serjeanty in gross, and its holders
were <i>servientes regis ad legem</i>. The word
<i>regis</i> was soon omitted except as regards
those specially retained for the royal service.
The literal translation of the other words is
Serjeants-at-law, still the designation of the
surviving fellows of the order. The Serjeant-at-law
was appointed, or, in form at least,
commanded to take office by writ under the
Great Seal. He was courteously addressed
as &#8220;you,&#8221; whilst the sheriff was commonly
plain &#8220;thou&#8221; or &#8220;thee.&#8221; The King&#8217;s or
Queen&#8217;s Serjeants were appointed by letters
patent; and though this official is extinct as
the dodo, he is mentioned after the Queen&#8217;s
Attorney-General as the public prosecutor in
the proclamation still mumbled at the opening
of courts like the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>Now, in the early Norman period the <i>aula
regis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> or Supreme Court, was simply the King
acting as judge with the assistance of his
great officers of state. In time there developed
therefrom among much else the three
old common law courts; whereof the Common
Pleas settled the disputes of subjects,
the King&#8217;s Bench, suits concerning the King
and the realm, the Exchequer, revenue
matters. Though the last two by means of
quaint fictions afterwards acquired a share
of private litigation, yet such was more properly
for the Court of Common Pleas. It
was peculiarly the Serjeants&#8217; court, and for
many centuries, up to fifty years ago, they
had the exclusive right of audience. Until
the Judicature Acts they were the body of
men next to the judges, each being addressed
from the bench as &#8220;Brother,&#8221; and from them
the judges must be chosen, also until 1850
the assizes must be held before a judge or a
Serjeant of the coif.</p>

<p>A clause in Magna Charta provided that
the Common Pleas should not follow the
King&#8217;s wanderings, but sit in a fixed place;
this fixed place came to be near the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
door of the Hall at Westminster. With
the wind in the north the spot was cold and
draughty, so after the Restoration some
daring innovator proposed &#8220;to let it (the
Court) in through the wall into a back room
which they called the treasury.&#8221; Sir Orlando
Bridgeman, the Chief Justice, would on no
account hear of this. To move it an inch
were flagrant violation of Magna Charta.
Might not, he darkly hinted, all its writs be
thus rendered null and void? Was legal
pedantry ever carried further? In a later
age the change was made without comment,
and in our own time the Common Pleas itself
has gone to the Lumber Room. No doubt
this early localising of the court helped to
develop a special Bar. Other species of
practitioners&mdash;barristers, attorneys, solicitors&mdash;in
time arose, and the appointment of
Queen&#8217;s Counsel, of whom Lord Bacon was
the earliest, struck the first real blow at the
Order of the Coif; but the detail of such
things is not for this page. In later days
every Serjeant was a more fully developed
banister, and then and now, as is well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
every barrister must belong to one of the
four Inns of Court&mdash;the two Temples, Gray&#8217;s
Inn, and Lincoln&#8217;s Inn to wit, whose history
cannot be told here; suffice it to say they
were voluntary associations of lawyers, which
gradually acquired the right of calling to
the Bar those who wished to practise.</p>

<p>Now, the method of appointment of Serjeants
was as follows: The judges, headed
by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,
picked out certain eminent barristers as
worthy of the dignity, their names were
given in to the Lord Chancellor, and in due
time each had his writ, whereof he formally
gave his Inn notice. His House entertained
him at a public breakfast, presented him
with a gold or silver net purse with ten
guineas or so as a retaining fee, the chapel
bell was tolled, and he was solemnly rung
out of the bounds. On the day of his call
he was harangued (often at preposterous
length) by the Chief Justice of the King&#8217;s
Bench, he knelt down, and the white coif of
the order was fitted on his head; he went in
procession to Westminster and &#8220;counted&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in a real action in the Court of Common
Pleas. For centuries he did so in law-French.
Lord Hardwicke was the first
Serjeant who &#8220;counted&#8221; in English. The
new-comer was admitted a member of
Serjeants&#8217; Inn, in Chancery Lane, in ancient
times called Farringdon Inn, whereof all the
members were Serjeants. Here they dined
together on the first and last days of term;
their clerks also dined in hall, though at a
separate table&mdash;a survival, no doubt, from
the days when the retainer feasted, albeit
&#8220;below the salt,&#8221; with his master. Dinner
done and the napery removed, the board of
green cloth was constituted, and under the
presidency of the Chief Judge the business of
the House was transacted. There was a
second Serjeants&#8217; Inn in Fleet Street, but in
1758 its members joined the older institution
in Chancery Lane. When the Judicature
Acts practically abolished the order, the Inn
was sold and its property divided among the
members, a scandalous proceeding and poor
result of &#8220;the wisdom of an heep of lernede
men&#8221;!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>The Serjeant&#8217;s feast on his appointment
was a magnificent affair, <i>instar coronationis</i>,
as Fortescue has it. In old times it lasted
seven days; one of the largest palaces in the
metropolis was selected, and kings and
queens graced its quaint ceremonial. Stow
chronicles one such celebration at the call of
eleven Serjeants, in 1531. There were consumed
&#8220;twenty-four great beefes, one
hundred fat muttons, fifty-one great veales,
thirty-four porkes,&#8221; not to mention the
swans, the larkes, the &#8220;capons of Kent,&#8221; the
&#8220;carcase of an ox from the shambles,&#8221; and
so forth. One fancies these solids were
washed down by potations proportionately
long and deep. And there were other
attractions and other expenses. At the
feast in October 1552, &#8220;a standing dish of
wax representing the Court of Common
Pleas&#8221; was the admiration of the guests;
again, a year or two later, it is noted that
each Serjeant was attended by three gentlemen
selected by him from among the
members of his own Inn to act as his sewer,
his carver, and his cup-bearer. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Gargantuan banquets must have proved a
sore burden: they were cut down to one
day, and, on the union of the Inns in 1758,
given up as unsuited to the newer times.</p>

<p>One expense remained. Serjeants on their
call must give gold rings to the Sovereign,
the Lord Chancellor, the judges, and many
others. From about the time of Elizabeth
mottoes or &#8220;posies&#8221; were engraved thereon.
Sometimes each Serjeant had his own device,
more commonly the whole call adopted the
same motto, which was usually a compliment
to the reigning monarch or an allusion to
some public event. Thus, after the Restoration
the words ran: <i>Adeste Corolus Magnus</i>.
With a good deal of elision and twisting the
Roman numerals for 1660 were extracted
from this, to the huge delight of the learned
triflers. <i>Imperium et libertas</i> was the word
for 1700, and <i>plus quam speravimus</i> that of
1714, which was as neat as any. The rings
were presented to the judges by the Serjeant&#8217;s
&#8220;colt,&#8221; as the barrister attendant on him
through the ceremony was called (probably
from <i>colt</i>, an apprentice); he also had a ring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
In the ninth of Geo. II. the fourteen new
Serjeants gave, as of duty, 1409 rings, valued
at £773. That call cost each Serjeant
nearly £200. This ring-giving continued
to the end; another custom, that of giving
liveries to relatives and friends, was discontinued
in 1759. In mediæval times the
new Serjeants went in procession to St.
Paul&#8217;s, and worshipped at the shrine of
Thomas à Becket; then to each was allotted
a pillar, so that his clients might know
where to find him. The Reformation put a
summary end to the worship of St. Thomas,
but the formality of the pillar lingered on
till Old St. Paul&#8217;s and Old London blazed in
the Great Fire of 1666.</p>

<p>The mediæval lawyer lives for us to-day in
Chaucer&#8217;s famous picture:</p>

<div class="verse">Gird with a seynt of silk, with barres smale</div>
<div class="verse">Of his array telle I no lenger tale.</div>
</div></div>

<p>How lifelike that touch of the fussy man,
who &#8220;seemede besier than he was&#8221;! But
each line might serve as text for a long
dissertation! The old court hours were
early: the judges sat from eight till eleven,
when your busy Serjeant would, after bolting
his dinner, hie him to his pillar where he
would hear his client&#8217;s story, &#8220;and take notes
thereof upon his knee.&#8221; The parvys or
pervyse of Paul&#8217;s&mdash;properly, only the church
door&mdash;had come to mean the nave of the
cathedral, called also &#8220;Paul&#8217;s Walk,&#8221; or
&#8220;Duke Humphrey&#8217;s Walk,&#8221; from the supposed
tomb of Duke Humphrey that stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
there. In Tudor times it was the great
lounge and common newsroom of London.
Here the needy adventurer &#8220;dined with
Duke Humphrey,&#8221; as the quaint euphemism
ran; here spies garnered in popular
opinion for the authorities. It was the very
place for the lawyer to meet his client, yet
had he other resorts: the round of the Temple
Church and Westminster are noted as in use
for consultations.</p>

<p>Chaucer&#8217;s Serjeant &#8220;rood but hoomly&#8221;
because he was travelling; in court he had a
long priest-like robe, with a furred cape
about his shoulders and a scarlet hood. The
gowns were various, and sometimes parti-coloured.
Thus, in 1555 we find each new
Serjeant possessed of one robe of scarlet, one
of violet, one of brown and blue, one of
mustard and murrey, with tabards (short
sleeveless coats) of cloths of the same colours.
The cape was edged, first with lambskin, afterwards
with more precious stuff. In Langland&#8217;s
<i>Vision of Piers Plowman</i> (1362) there
is mention of this dress of the Serjeants, they
are jibed at for their love of fees and so forth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
after a fashion that is not yet extinct! But
<i>the</i> distinctive feature in the dress was the
coif, a close-fitting head covering made of
white lawn or silk. A badge of honour, it
was worn on all professional occasions, nor
was it doffed even in the King&#8217;s presence.
In monumental effigies it is ever prominent.
When a Serjeant resigned his dignity he was
formally discharged from the obligation of
wearing it. To discuss its exact origin were
fruitless, yet one ingenious if mistaken conjecture
may be noticed. Our first lawyers
were churchmen, but in 1217 these were
finally debarred from general practice in the
courts. Many were unwilling to abandon so
lucrative a calling, but what about the
tonsure? &#8220;They were for decency and
comeliness allowed to cover their bald pates
with a coif, which had been ever since retained.&#8221;
Thus the learned Serjeant Wynne
in his tract on the antiquity and dignity of
the order (1765). In Tudor times, if not
before, fashion required the Serjeant to wear
a small skull-cap of black silk or velvet on
the top of the coif. This is very clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
shown in one of Lord Coke&#8217;s portraits.
Under Charles II. lawyers, like other folk,
began to wear wigs, the more exalted they
were the bigger their perukes. It was wittily
said that Bench and Bar went into mourning
on Queen Anne&#8217;s death, and so remained,
since their present dress is that then adopted.
Serjeants were unwilling to lose sight of their
coifs altogether, and it was suggested on the
wig by a round patch of black and white,
representing the white coif and the cap which
had covered it. The limp cap of black cloth
known as the &#8220;black cap&#8221; which the judge
assumes when about to pass sentence of death
was, it seems, put on to veil the coif, and as
a sign of sorrow. It was also carried in the
hand when attending divine service, and was
possibly assumed in pre-Reformation times
when prayers were said for the dead.</p>

<p>A few words will tell of the fall of the
order. As far back as 1755 Sir John Willis,
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, proposed
to throw open that court as well as the
office of judge to banisters who were not
Serjeants, but the suggestion came to nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
In 1834, the Bill for the establishment of a
Central Criminal Court contained a clause
to open the Common Pleas; this was
dropped, but the same object was attained
by a royal warrant, April 25, 1834. The
legality of this was soon questioned and,
after solemn argument before the Privy
Council, it was declared invalid. In 1846
a statute (the 9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 54) to the
same effect settled the matter, and the
Judicature Act of 1873 provided that no
judge need in future be a Serjeant. On the
dissolution of Serjeants&#8217; Inn its members
were received back into the Houses whence
they had come.</p>

<p>As for centuries all the judges were
Serjeants, the history of the order is that of
the Bench and Bar of England; yet some
famous men rose no higher, or for one reason
or other became representative members.
Such a one was Sir John Maynard (1602-1690).
In his last years William III. commented
on his venerable appearance: &#8220;He
must have outlived all the lawyers of his
time.&#8221; &#8220;If your Highness had not come I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
should have outlived the law itself,&#8221; was the
old man&#8217;s happy compliment. Pleading in
Chancery one day, he remarked that he had
been counsel in the same case half a century
before, he had steered a middle course in
those troubled times, but he had ever leant
to the side of freedom against King and
Protector alike. His share in the impeachment
of Strafford procured him a jibe in
Butler&#8217;s <i>Hudibras</i>, yet it was said that all
parties seemed willing to employ him, and
that he seemed willing to be employed by
all. Jeffreys, who usually deferred to him,
once blustered out, &#8220;You are so old as to
forget your law, Brother Maynard.&#8221; &#8220;True,
Sir George, I have forgotton more law than
ever you knew,&#8221; was the crushing retort.
Macaulay has justly praised his conduct at
the Revolution for that he urged his party
to disregard legal technicalities and adopt
new methods for new and unheard-of circumstances.
Edmund Plowden (1518-1585) deserves
at least equally high praise. He was
so determined a student that &#8220;for three
years he went not once out of the Temple.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
He is said to have refused the Chancellorship
offered him by Elizabeth as he would not
desert the old faith. He was attacked again
and again for nonconformity, but his profound
knowledge of legal technicalities enabled
him on each occasion to escape the
net spread for him. He was an Englishman
loyal to the core, and Catholic as he was
opposed in 1555 the violent proceedings of
Queen Mary&#8217;s Parliament. The Attorney-General
filed a bill against him for contempt,
but &#8220;Mr. Plowden traversed fully, and the
matter was never decided.&#8221; &#8220;A traverse full
of pregnancy,&#8221; is Lord Coke&#8217;s enthusiastic
comment. On his death in 1584 they buried
him in that Temple Church whose soil must
have seemed twice sacred to this oracle of
the law. An alabaster monument whereon
his effigy reposes remains to this day. A
less distinguished contemporary was William
Bendloes (1516-1584), &#8220;Old Bendloes,&#8221; men
called him. A quaint legend reports him
the only Serjeant at the Common Pleas bar
in the first year of Elizabeth&#8217;s reign. Whether
there was no business, or merely half-guinea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
motions of course, or the one man argued on
both sides, or whether the whole story be a
fabrication, &#8217;tis scarce worth while to inquire.</p>

<p>I pass to more modern times. William
Davy was made Serjeant-at-law in 1754.
His wit combats with Lord Mansfield are
still remembered. His lordship was credited
with a desire to sit on Good Friday; our
Serjeant hinted that he would be the first
judge that had done so since Pontius Pilate!
Mansfield scouted one of Davy&#8217;s legal propositions.
&#8220;If that be law I must burn all
my books.&#8221; &#8220;Better read them first,&#8221; was
the quiet retort. In recent days two of the
best known Serjeants were Parry and Ballantine,
the first a profound lawyer, the second
a great advocate, but both are vanished from
the scene.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
